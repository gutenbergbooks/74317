<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The present work has no pretensions to anything beyond being an attempt
at supplying a hiatus in the history of Scotland which has hitherto
been left unfilled. By the few historians who, in days gone by, devoted
their attention to the subject, the earlier portion of Scottish
history, more especially the period before the reign of Malcolm
Ceanmore, seems to have been tacitly abandoned as a battleground for
theorists—a sort of debateable land upon which they attacked or
defended their various systems, wielding their feathered weapons with
quite as much hostility as ever Pict, Scot, or Attacot displayed in
actual combat, though (perhaps more fortunately for themselves than for
their readers) without similarly fatal consequences. In the company of
these enthusiasts I first endeavoured to trace out the history of the
past, until, dissatisfied with my guides, I turned to chartulary and
chronicle, with the result which is now before the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<p>I feel that an apology may be needed for the length and number of the
Appendices, some of which will, perhaps, appear at first sight to
have but little reference to the history of Scotland. Many questions,
however, had to be discussed, many points to be raised or settled,
which, though possessing little interest for the general reader, could
not be passed over altogether; and such discussions, accordingly, I
decided upon consigning to the Appendix. It will also be found that I
have, not unfrequently, wandered from the beaten track; and wherever
I have differed from usually received opinions I have felt bound to
record my reasons for doing so. The remaining Appendices, though they
may occasionally be devoted to questions comparatively foreign to
Scottish history, embody the reasons which have guided me in forming
many of my conclusions. I am very far from implying that it would have
been impossible to write the early history of Scotland without entering
upon the subjects of which they treat; I only plead my own inability to
do so.</p>

<p>I have nothing more to add except that, as I put forward no claim to
infallibility, and as my sole object has been to ascertain the truth,
wherever it is clearly shown that I have failed in arriving at the
end in view, I shall unhesitatingly acknowledge myself to have been
mistaken. I have already sacrificed too many theories to object to the
necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> immolation of as many more as may be proved to be erroneous;
for historical accuracy will scarcely be attained by too rigid an
adherence to preconceived ideas. The kindly interest and encouragement
with which my work has been received by those whom I have long been
accustomed to regard as the first living authorities upon the subjects
of which it treats, and to whose contributions to Scottish history
it really owes any merits it may possess, have been, I need not say,
extremely gratifying to me. I trust I may accept this as an omen of
success, and as an assurance that I have not uselessly sacrificed both
time and labour in endeavouring to shed a few more rays of light upon
the early history of the land of my forefathers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="subhed"><span class="smcap">The Early History—Before</span> <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 843.</span></h2>

<p>Britain, dimly recognisable in the vague accounts given by Hecatæus
of a large island off the coast of Gaul inhabited by a sacred race
of <i>Hyperboreans</i>, and sometimes even disputing with Iceland
the questionable honour of having been known as <i>Ultima Thule</i>,
owes her first introduction within the pale of authentic history to
the ambitious policy of the Cæsars. The historian, however, finds
little worth recording about the northern districts during the Roman
occupation of the island, and that little belongs rather to the
province of the antiquary. A transitory gleam of light is shed upon
the subject by the pen of Tacitus; <span class="sni">A. D. 80–4.</span> but the
campaigns of Agricola were unproductive of results, and northern
Britain again sinks into obscurity until the Emperor Hadrian deemed
it necessary for the protection of the Roman province to throw up a
turf rampart across the narrowest portion of the island, extending
from the Solway to the Tyne. <span class="sni">A. D. 120.</span> Twenty years later
another was added between the Forth and Clyde, connecting the old line
of forts erected by Agricola, and known, from the reign in which it
was built, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> the Wall of Antonine; but after a fruitless struggle
of sixty years the whole of the district between these walls was
abandoned by Severus, when he raised a third rampart, built of stone,
immediately to the northward of the original bulwark. <span class="sni">A. D.
208.</span> From this period the Roman province was bounded by the southern
wall, and though towards the close of the fourth century the energy
of Theodosius reasserted the dominion of the empire over the district
between Forth and Tyne, <span class="sni">A. D. 369.</span> which now received the
name of Valentia in honour of the Emperor Valens, the newly-established
province was soon relinquished, and about the opening of the following
century Britain was finally abandoned by her ancient masters. Long
before this period the incursions of the northern tribes upon the Roman
province <span class="sni">A. D. 407.</span> had become incessant, and some idea
may be formed of the distance to which they occasionally penetrated,
from the account left by Ammianus Marcellinus, that Theodosius, after
landing at <i>Rutupe</i>, the modern Richborough, was obliged to fight
his way through Kent, swarming with their hostile bands, before he
could reach the capital, Augusta, described by the historian as “an old
town formerly known as London.” Their earlier title of Caledonians had
by this time disappeared, and they were generally known as Picts, a
name including the two great divisions of Vecturiones and Dicaledones,
answering apparently to the later confederacies of northern and
southern Picts.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Britain after the departure of the legionaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> appears to have
suffered her full share of the calamities of that disastrous epoch,
and the episodes of invasion and conquest enacted throughout the
continental provinces of the expiring empire were repeated with similar
results, within the narrower limits of her ancient island dependency.
A continuous stream of Teutonic invaders poured without ceasing upon
her shores, Jutes, Saxons, and Frisians peopling the south-eastern
coasts, whilst further towards the north swarmed the Anglian tribes
who were destined to fix an imperishable name upon the island. Towards
the middle of the sixth century an additional impetus appears to have
been given to the torrent of Anglian invasion by the arrival of Ida,
the reputed founder of the Northumbrian kingdom, and leader of the
Bernician Angles, whose descendants formed so important an element
in the Teutonic population of southern Scotland. No record of his
prowess is to be found in the annals of his countrymen; his name alone
survives with that of his forgotten foe, “the dark lord”—Dutigern;
but the precipitate flight of the British bishop from York, the
sudden extinction of Christianity throughout the diocese, the name of
<i>Gwrth Bryneich</i>—or Bernicia’s thraldom—by which the famous
fortress of Bamborough was known amongst the conquered people, and
the ominous title of “the Flame-Bearer,” applied to the mighty Angle
in the lays of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> hostile bards, sufficiently attest the ruthless
energy with which he extended the dominion of his race from the marshy
plains of Holderness to the distant islets of the Forth.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From
the Humber to the Tyne the country was known amongst the Britons as
<i>Deheubarth</i>, or “the southern part,” whilst beyond that river
and the ruins of the southern wall, the district stretching to the
Forth was distinguished as <i>Bryneich</i>, or “the country of the
braes;” and it was within the boundaries of the latter province that
the Anglian population of the Lothians first established themselves as
conquerors in the land which their descendants still occupy.</p>

<p>Ida fell in battle, slain, say the British authorities, by Owen of
Reged, whose father Urien, the favourite hero of the bards, and a
warrior from whom many a laurel has been stolen to adorn the chaplet of
the fabulous Arthur, was hailed unanimously as leader of a confederacy
which was to drive the invader from the soil. The tide of conquest
was now rolled back upon the Angles, Bryneich was recovered, and the
sons of Ida were driven from the land, when at the very moment of his
triumph the bravest champion of his race fell by the dagger of “Llovan
of the accursed hand,” and his death was fatal to his countrymen. Step
by step the Angles recovered their ascendency, winning their way at the
point of the sword, until the whole of the eastern coast was wrested
from its original possessors, confined henceforth to the westward of
“the Desert,” and the Northumbrian kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia rose
out of the ruins of the conquered British principalities.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>A solitary entry in the annals of the Irish abbot, Tighernach, affords
the earliest historical testimony of the arrival of a small, but in
many respects a remarkable, band of colonists, about fifty years before
the settlement of an Anglian population in the Lothians, upon the rocky
and indented coasts of southern Argyle. <span class="sni">A. D. 502.</span> Fergus
Mor MacEarca, a chieftain of the Irish Gael, was their leader, and
the north-eastern extremity of the modern county of Antrim, which, at
that time, formed part of the territories of the Irish Picts, was the
locality which they abandoned when they crossed the channel in their
leathern coracles in search of another home upon the shores of Britain.
Amidst the lakes and mountains to the southward of Loch Linne, Fergus
and his followers fixed their new abode; and the limits of his petty
kingdom, which were never enlarged, are still traceable in the names
implanted by succeeding princes upon the dependent districts of Lorn,
Cowal, and Kintyre. These principalities, with a few of the islands
off the coast of southern Argyle, made up, collectively, the whole of
the kingdom of Dalriada—for such was its real name; though in the
Latin chronicles of a later age, Fergus and his descendants invariably
appear under the more familiar appellation of “Kings of the Scots.” The
annals of the Dalriads are totally devoid of interest before the reign
of Conal, fourth in succession from Fergus Mor, who, by the shelter
he afforded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> the exiled Abbot of Durrow, indirectly furthered the
conversion of the northern Picts to Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was in consequence of a feud between the leading clans of the royal
race of Ireland, that the apostle of the northern Picts first quitted
the home of his earlier years and dedicated the remainder of his life
to the labours of a missionary. On the occasion of one of those great
meetings of the clergy and laity of Ireland, to which such frequent
allusion is made in her annals, a son of Aodh, king of Connaught, who
happened to be present in full reliance upon a promise of immunity from
Columba, was seized and put to death by order of Dermot MacKerval, lord
of the southern Hy Nial, and at that time <i>Ardrigh</i>, or supreme
king of Ireland. Columba, who was then abbot of Durrow, was also a
member of the same great sept, and closely allied by birth to the king
of one of the northern branches—the Clan Conal; and his kinsmen, bound
by the usual ties of relationship to avenge the insult, uniting with
the king of Connaught, inflicted so severe a defeat upon the aggressor,
that his whole wrath was turned upon Columba, whom he caused to be
excommunicated by the leading clergy of Meath. Dreading the further
effects of his enemy’s vengeance, Columba bade adieu to his native
land; and, under the curse of man, sought those shores to which, under
the blessing of God, he was destined to become, indeed, a messenger of
good tidings.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>Arriving with the usual complement of twelve followers, off the coast
of Argyle, he obtained permission from Conal, king of the Dalriads, to
appropriate the little island of Iona, and after employing himself for
two years in establishing and regulating his brotherhood, he prepared
to enter upon his allotted task, and to penetrate across the mountain
barrier of Drumalban. <span class="sni">A. D. 565.</span> Not far from the spot
where the river Ness issues from the parent lake of which it assumes
the name, there still exist the vestiges of an ancient earthwork,
ascribed by the tradition of the country to a Pictish king; and thither
Columba and his companions bent their steps, for Bruidi MacMalcon, who
at this time held supreme sway over both divisions of the Picts, held
his court within the ramparts of this <i>Rath</i> or <i>Dun</i>. As the
arrival of the Christian missionary appears to have been expected, he
was opposed by a number of the Pictish Druids, but as their hostility
seems to have been limited to the use of incantations and enchantments,
little real hindrance could have been offered to his progress, and he
reached, without difficulty, the residence of the king. As the gates
of the royal fortress close upon the little band, all knowledge ceases
of the further proceedings of Columba; the bare record of the success
of his mission has descended to posterity, and the people acquiescing,
as in duty bound, in their sovereign’s renunciation of idolatry, both
divisions of the Pictish people were henceforth united in belief.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p>An interesting description of the disciples and successors of Columba
has been handed down in the pages of a writer, whose difference with
the Gaelic clergy in certain trivial points of faith did not blind him
to the virtues and real merits of the earliest apostles of Christianity
to his own heathen forefathers. Shut out in their distant northern
home from the knowledge of synodical decrees, and constrained to seek
their doctrine and rule of conduct in the writings of the prophets,
the evangelists, and the apostles, the simple denizens of the sea-girt
Iona were conspicuous for the purity of their unblemished morals, for
their fervent attachment to their divine Master, and for their strict
adherence to the precepts and traditions of the revered founder of the
brotherhood. As they preached so they practised, their own blameless
manner of life affording the best commentary on their doctrine; and
when they issued forth from their monastery to baptise and to instruct,
to convert the infidel and to strengthen the believer, the offerings
forced upon them by the gratitude of the powerful and the rich were
employed in relieving the wants of the poor and in alleviating the
sufferings of the sick—in restoring freedom to the captive and in
purchasing liberty for the slave. Such is the picture drawn by the
venerable Beda of Aidan and his fellow-labourers in the work of
converting the Angles of Northumbria; worthy inheritors of the virtues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and devotion of Columba, and bright examples of the pure and simple
piety inspired by the zeal of Patrick amongst the early fathers of his
church.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>For about a century and a half after the arrival of Columba, Iona
continued in the position of the leading monastery of the north,
extending her authority over many parts of Ireland, and bidding fair at
one time to establish a similar influence throughout southern Britain,
until a dispute about matters of comparatively trivial importance
abruptly severed her connection with Northumbria. A difference of
opinion had long existed between the clergy of the Picts, Britons,
and northern Irish, on the one hand, and the followers of Augustine
amongst the Anglo-Saxons, on the other, together with the ecclesiastics
of southern Ireland, who had been latterly brought to conform to
the practice authorised by the see of Rome. The proper time for the
celebration of the Easter festival, and the orthodox form of the
clerical tonsure, were the subjects in dispute; and though the former
was clearly a question of astronomical calculation, and the tonsure was
a badge of Paganism in the days of the primitive church, both points
originated frequent and animated discussions, and were debated in the
seventh century as important matters of faith. <span class="sni">A.D. 664.</span>
Colman and his followers, at the celebrated conference of Whitby, had
bade adieu to their adopted country sooner than relinquish the practice
they had inherited from their predecessors; and fifty years later a
similar tenacity in favour of “ancient customs” brought about the
expulsion of the clergy of Iona from the territories of the Pictish
sovereign. Nectan MacDeriloi, in consequence of a difference of opinion
with his clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> about the points in question, dispatched envoys to
Ceolfred, abbot of Wearmouth, requesting his decision upon the matters
in dispute, and, at the same time, inviting the assistance of Saxon
architects to build a stone church after the approved Roman model. The
abbot responded to both appeals, and though every vestige of the stone
church has long since disappeared, the letter of Ceolfred may still be
read in the pages of the historian Beda. It strengthened and confirmed
the king in his own convictions, and <span class="sni">A.D. 717.</span> he decided
that his clergy should conform accordingly; but they were as firm in
their resolution as Colman; and Nectan, summarily ordering them across
Drumalban, appears to have transferred to his recent foundation (which
seems to have been Abernethy) the pre-eminence amongst the monasteries
of northern Britain, which had hitherto been the peculiar prerogative
of Iona.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the arrival of the Angles upon the coasts of Valentia is dimly
traceable in the scanty records of the period, and the settlement of
the Dalriads in a portion of Argyle is historically noticed by the
earliest annalist of Ireland, a barren and corrupt, but singularly
accurate list of uncouth names is the sole record of the Pictish
people before the opening of the seventh century, when the confusion
resulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> upon the death of the Northumbrian Ethelfrith compelled his
children to seek a refuge amongst the friendly people of the north.
The bitter spirit of animosity engendered in the Angles by their
incessant hostilities with the Britons is hardly traceable in their
early relations with the Picts, and accordingly a ready welcome was
extended to the youthful exiles, who were instructed in the knowledge
of the Christian faith by the Gaelic clergy, and sheltered for fifteen
years beyond the protecting barrier of the Forth. The residence of
the Northumbrian <i>Athelings</i> amongst the Picts was productive of
important consequences; Eanfred, the eldest of the brothers, became
the husband of a Pictish princess—and their son Talorcan was numbered
amongst the Pictish kings—whilst Oswald, after recovering his father’s
throne, sought from amongst the instructors of his early youth those
holy men through whose assistance he hoped to spread abroad amongst his
people the blessings of the novel faith which he had learnt to prize so
dearly.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>After the death of this amiable prince upon the fatal field of Winwed,
the ties of affection and good will which had hitherto united the sons
of Ethelfrith with the people who had sheltered them in adversity were
severed during the reign of his harsher brother Oswy, and exchanged for
the galling bonds of conquest. Province after province bowed to the
Anglian yoke, until the majority of the neighbouring Pictish princes
were ranged with the Dalriads, who shared the same lot, amongst the
tributaries of the Northumbrian sovereign, and though they endeavoured
to regain their liberty when <span class="sni">A. D. 670.</span> Egfrid ascended the
throne, their premature attempt only served to rivet their fetters more
securely. About eleven years later a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> yet more decisive step was taken
towards the permanent annexation of the tributary Pictish provinces,
and Egfrid, when he divided the overgrown diocese of Wilfrid into
the Sees of York, Hexham, and Lindisfarne, appointed Trumwine to the
bishopric of the Picts, choosing Abercorn, upon the southern bank of
<span class="sni">A. D. 681.</span> the Forth, as the seat of the new Episcopate.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Five years after the erection of the See of Abercorn, <span class="sni">A.
D. 685.</span> for some unknown cause, Egfrid, repeating the ravages of his
Irish expedition of the previous year, poured a mighty army across
the Forth, burning the <i>Raths</i> of Tulach-Aman, and Dun Ollaig.
His progress was unopposed, and penetrating into the neighbouring
province of Angus, he crossed the Tay without resistance, and skirted
the base of the Grampian range until he approached the neighbourhood
of Lin Garan or Nectan’s Mere, a little lake in the modern parish of
Dunnichen. Here his antagonist, who was his cousin Bruidi, awaited
with his followers the hostile onset, the signal overthrow of the
invading force justifying the choice of the position. The victory was
as glorious as its consequences were important, Egfrid and the greater
part of his army were left upon the field, whilst few escaped from the
scene of slaughter to carry back to Northumbria the tidings of her
monarch’s fall. All that the conquests of thirty years had wrested from
the Picts was lost for ever to the race of Ida, and the Saxon bishop,
abandoning in terror his See of Abercorn, never rested in his hurried
flight until within the walls of Whitby he had placed the whole breadth
of Bernicia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> between himself and his rebellious flock. The Dalriads
also recovered their former liberty, and even the Britons enjoyed a
momentary independence, and through the losses and embarrassments
entailed upon Northumbria by the disastrous overthrow of Egfrid, the
pre-eminence of the Northern Angles received a fatal shock which the
utmost efforts of succeeding princes failed altogether to repair.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>During the forty years which elapsed after the victory of Nectan’s Mere
an occasional conflict with the Angles testifies to the embittered
feelings which had arisen through Northumbrian aggression; and upon
the abdication of Nectan, the correspondent of Ceolfred and somewhat
arbitrary reformer of the Gaelic clergy, who after a reign of eighteen
years relinquished his throne for the cloister, a contest seems to have
arisen between four Pictish kings, which, after five years, terminated
in the undisputed ascendancy of Angus Mac Fergus. <span class="sni">A. D.
730.</span> Fortune proved true to her favourite, whose alliance was courted
at different periods by the Mercian and Northumbrian sovereigns, and
in the results of his victories over his various competitors, and of
his conquests over the Dalriads and the northern Britons, may be traced
apparently the germs of the future kingdom of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Confined within the narrow district to the southward of Loch Linne
and to the westward of the mountain range of Drumalban, the Dalriad
princes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> exercised but little influence upon the great confederacy of
the Picts, their usual opponents being the Britons, and in early times
the Angles, against whom both Britons and Dalriads occasionally appear
to have united. Their fleet is sometimes mentioned in the Irish annals,
a hostile expedition against the Islesmen disclosing the limited extent
of their dominion in the western seas.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The most prosperous era in
the annals of the little kingdom coincides with Columba’s residence
in Iona, after Conal, the early patron of the saint, was succeeded by
Aidan Mac Gauran, the enterprising and able leader of the clans of
Kintyre, the names of whose numerous battles, preserved in the annals
and biographies of the period, amply testify to his warlike qualities
without throwing much light on the causes of their display. His latest
antagonist was the Northumbrian Ethelfrith, <span class="sni">A. D. 603.</span> from
whom he received so severe a check at Degsa’s Stone, that the Angles
were allowed henceforth to prosecute their career of conquest over the
Britons without interference from the Dalriads, who with the exception
of an occasional contest with their neighbours on the Clyde seem to
have turned their attention to the opposite coasts of <i>Uladh</i>.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
For a quarter of a century and upwards they were tributaries along with
the Picts of the Northumbrian kingdom, regaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> their independence
after the battle of Nectan’s Mere, though it may be gathered from the
words of Adamnan and from certain notices in the annalists, that the
predominance in the kingdom passed about this time from Kintyre to the
house of Lorn, whose chieftain, Selvach, seems to have rivalled Aidan
in the number of his battles, fought generally, as in the case of the
latter prince, against the Britons of Strath Clyde. <span class="sni">A. D.
723.</span> The abdication and death of Selvach were fatal to the supremacy
of his house; the authority of his son, Dungal, being quickly confined
<span class="sni">A. D. 730.</span> within the limits of the paternal inheritance,
which he was destined a few years later to lose through a wanton
outrage upon a connection of the formidable Angus. Bruidi, a son of the
Pictish sovereign, appears to have fled for some cause to the island
of <i>Toraic</i>, <span class="sni">A. D. 733.</span> where he was followed—or
found—by Dungal, who forced him from the sanctuary in which he had
taken refuge. The devastation of Lorn in the following year, and the
destruction of the two <span class="sni">A. D. 734.</span> <i>Raths</i> of Dunleven
and Dunadd, attest the vigour with which Angus avenged the insult;
Dungal and his brother Feredach were carried off in chains in the
victor’s train, and two years later the defeat of Muredach, <span class="sni">
A. D. 736.</span> the last known member of the family, upon the shores of
Loch Linne, completed the ruin of the house of Lorn. The scanty records
of the period throw no farther light upon the subject, Lorn and its
princes disappear from history, and the success of Angus would appear
to have extended not only to the conquest of the province in question,
but to the temporary subjection of the entire kingdom of Dalriada.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>The alliance with Ethelbald the Proud seems to have involved Angus
in a collision at different epochs with the West Saxons and the
Northumbrians, though a connection of a more friendly nature arose
at a later period with the Bernician Eadbert, one of the greatest
restorers of the Northumbrian power, the alliance being probably based
upon the mutual spoliation of the Britons. The conquests of Ethelfrith
in the neighbourhood of Chester, and the victories of Edwin in the
south-west of Yorkshire, when he drove Ceretic, or Caradoc, from the
forest district of Elmete, appear to have made the first impression
upon the lengthened tract of country to the westward of “the Desert,”
the true home of the Cymri, extending from the Severn to the Clyde,
in which a number of petty princes and kinglets long united in paying
some sort of deference to the authority of one supreme king, or
<i>Unben</i>.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The faint remains of a line of defence, dictated
possibly by a recollection of imperial tactics, can still be traced
towards the north-eastern frontier of this British territory under the
name of the <i>Catrail or Pictswork ditch</i>, stretching from Peel
Fell through the south-western portion of Roxburghshire to Galashiels
in Selkirkshire; and to the westward of this barrier the Britons
long remained upon a footing of comparative independence, after they
had lost all hold upon the more open country in the vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Mercia, at the period of Edwin’s reign, was under the rule of Penda,
a chieftain who, to a hatred and contempt of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> Christianity, joined an
ardent desire of shaking off his dependence upon the kindred Angles
beyond the Humber, and encouraging the designs of the British princes
against the conqueror of Caradoc, he united the pagan warriors of
Mercia with the Christian followers of Caswallon, re-establishing the
supremacy of the Britons over the ancient city of York, by the defeat
and death of Edwin, though the triumph was purchased at the price of
the temporary extinction of Christianity. But the alliance between
Christian and pagan was of evil omen, and the death of Caswallon in
the following year destroyed the hopes of the Britons, though they
again swelled the forces of the heathen Penda, when he lost his life
near the Broad Arc, Cadwal of Gwynneth alone escaping from the field.
Cadwallader, the last king whose authority is supposed to have been
supreme, died of the pestilence in 664; and towards the close of
the same century the conquests of Egfred extended the Northumbrian
dominions to the western coast, and with his numerous donations of
lands in the modern counties of Lancashire and Cumberland to the
Northumbrian clergy, interposed a permanent barrier between the Britons
of North Wales, Cumberland, and Strath Clyde.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>Henceforth the ancient confederacy of the Britons seems to have been
broken up into the separate divisions of Wales, and English and
Scottish Cumbria—or Cumberland and Strath Clyde—never again destined
to be reunited under the authority of one supreme <i>Unben</i>. During
the reign of the Northumbrian Alfred, the Angles began to extend
their encroachments from the neighbourhood of Carlisle along the
whole of the south-western coast, known in a later age as Galloway,
their possessions in this quarter having increased, shortly before
the death of Beda, to such an extent as to justify their usual policy
of establishing a bishopric; and accordingly, Whithern, or Candida
Casa, the traditional see of Ninian, was revived, and placed under
the superintendence of a line of Anglian bishops, which was abruptly
brought to a close about a century later. The successes of Eadbert
reduced the fortunes of the Britons in this quarter to the lowest ebb.
Kyle was rendered tributary to Northumbria, which already included
Cunningham; <span class="sni">A. D. 756.</span> and shortly after the middle of the
century, Alclyde or Dumbarton, the strongest bulwark of the Northern
Britons, surrendered to the united forces of the Northumbrians and the
Picts. The capture of Alclyde must have thrown the whole of the ancient
British territories in the Lennox, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> were subsequently included in
the diocese of Glasgow, into the power of Angus, together with a great
portion of the “debateable land” between Forth and Clyde, similarly
included in the “Cumbrian” diocese; and the little principality of
Strath Clyde was now completely hemmed in and surrounded by hostile
territories, though the gradual decline of the Northumbrian power
towards the close of the eighth century, enabled the petty state to
struggle on for another hundred years in a precarious species of
nominal independence.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>After the death of Angus MacFergus, king of the Picts, <span class="sni">A.
D. 761.</span> who is stigmatized by a Saxon writer as “a bloody tyrant,”
the history of the succeeding period again becomes obscure. Bruidi his
brother followed him on the throne, which, after the death of Bruidi,
and an interval of fifteen years, during which it was again occupied
in succession by two brothers, reverted once more to the family of
Angus in the persons of his son and grandson—Constantine MacFergus,
<span class="sni">A. D. 789.</span> also probably a member of the same race,
acquiring the supreme power towards the close of the century by driving
out Conal MacTeige, who lost his life a few years later in Kintyre. The
names of three kings of Dalriada attest the existence of the little
kingdom, without throwing any further light upon its history, though
from the character of a subsequent reference to Aodh “the Fair,” it may
be conjectured that he was in some sense the restorer of the line of
Kintyre. <span class="sni">A. D. 792.</span> After the death of Doncorcin, the last
of these three princes, which happened shortly after the accession of
Constantine, no further mention of the province will be found in any of
the Irish annals which have hitherto been published.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>For thirty years and upwards, the supremacy of Constantine was
undisputed, and he was succeeded upon his death by his brother Angus,
his son Drost, and his nephew Eoganan in the same regular order which
is subsequently observable amongst the early kings of Scotland.
His reign was unquestionably an era of considerable importance,
tradition connecting it with the termination of the Pictish monarchy,
and representing Constantine as the last of the Pictish kings—a
tradition which must have owed its origin to a vague recollection of
some momentous change about this period. He and his brother Angus
are numbered most suspiciously amongst the immediate predecessors of
Kenneth MacAlpin in the “Duan of Alban,” the oldest known genealogy of
the early kings of Scotland; whilst the name of Constantine, unknown
amongst the paternal ancestry of Kenneth, was borne by his son and many
of his race, who would thus appear to have looked for their title to
the throne quite as much to their maternal as to their paternal line of
ancestry—for the mother of Alpin, Kenneth’s father, was traditionally
a daughter of the house of Fergus.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> of Dunkeld, in
Atholl, during the same reign, and of St. Andrews, in Fife, during the
reign of the younger Angus, point to the incorporation of both those
provinces amongst the dominions of the Pictish sovereigns; for it is
observable that the erection of a monastery was generally coincident
with the reduction under the royal authority of the province over which
the newly instituted abbot exercised jurisdiction, the authority of the
ecclesiastical superior confirming and sanctifying as it were the power
of the sovereign; and it will be found that when regular dioceses were
instituted in the twelfth century, the whole of Dalriada had long been
incorporated amongst the districts acknowledging the jurisdiction of
Constantine’s monastery of Dunkeld. The Anglian line of bishops also
disappear during the same reign from the diocese of Whithern, and a
population of Gaelic origin, distinguished from the earlier masters of
the soil, whether of Cumbrian or Northumbrian race, is subsequently
discovered in possession of the entire district.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The power of
Northumbria was on the wane, her people, distracted by civil contests,
were fast relinquishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> the hold they had once acquired upon the
districts to the westward of the Lothians; and as the Angles, weakened
by internal discord, no longer opposed a formidable barrier to the
Northern tribes, the latter, gradually increasing in power, seem to
have been fast settling into a stronger and more compact kingdom, in
which may be traced the nucleus of modern Scotland.</p>

<p>The erection of Dunkeld, the sole deed of Constantine that has
descended to posterity, may be traced to the inroads of the Northern
<i>Vikings</i>, who, four years after his accession, made their first
recorded appearance upon the British coasts, ravaging in the same year
Lindisfarne and Iona. A few of the Scottish monks who escaped with
life bore with them the relics of their founder, distributing their
sacred charge between the new foundation of the Pictish sovereign and
another monastery raised at Kells in Ireland; whilst the pre-eminence
throughout North Briton, which had passed to Abernethy from Iona,
appears to have been again transferred from the former monastery, and
vested in Dunkeld, which was destined in its turn, before the close of
the century, to be eclipsed and supplanted by St. Andrews.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 839.</div>

<p>The male line of the family of Fergus appears to have terminated in
the sons of the younger Angus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> Eoganan and Bran, who were both killed
in a disastrous battle with the Northmen; and for three years the two
sons of Bargoit, Feredach and Bruidi, reigned over the Picts, the death
of Bruidi making way for the first prince of the line of Dalriada,
<span class="sni">A. D. 843.</span> Kenneth MacAlpin, who seems to have ascended the
throne in right of the maternal ancestry of his father. For the next
two centuries the united people of the Picts and Scots acknowledged the
dominion of the MacAlpin dynasty; and though Kenneth and his immediate
successors were still recorded in the annals of the age under the
original title of “Kings of the Picts,” from the opening of the tenth
century the ancient name of <i>Pict</i>, gradually dying out, was
superseded by the more familiar appellation of <i>Scot</i>, extending,
in course of time, to every tribe and every race from the Tweed and the
Solway to the Pentland Firth, whose chieftains and leaders, whether
native noble, or feudal baron, owned the authority and followed the
banner of the representatives of the princes of Kintyre.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="subhed"><span class="smcap">The Kingdom of Scotland</span>—843–900.</span></h2></div>

<p>The history of Scotland as a kingdom may be said in general terms to
begin with the accession of the family of Kintyre; but the Scotland
of the period of the MacAlpin dynasty, both in the extent of the
territory to which Kenneth actually succeeded, as well as in the
nature of his authority over the remainder of the kingdom, bore only
a partial resemblance to the more compact feudal monarchy of a later
era. Gaul, before the achievements of Julius Cæsar annexed that
country to the dominion of Rome, must have presented an example of a
pure Celtic system of government; and the features of that system, as
described in the Commentaries of the conqueror, are plainly traceable
amongst the kindred Celtic populations of the British Isles. The
greater states, such as the Ædui, appear to have been aristocratic
confederacies, generally exercising a sort of leadership over a number
of lesser dependencies, electing annually a magistrate, judge, or
<i>Vergobreith</i>, to govern with royal authority, and the power
of life and death, and guarding, with jealous care, against the
perpetuation of this authority as a hereditary appanage in any one
family. In other confederacies this second phase had been brought about
with more or less permanent success, and Tasgetius was re-established
by Cæsar in the “<i>kingdom</i>” which his ancestors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> had acquired
over the Carnutes—a proceeding which within three years cost him his
life—whilst Cavarinus was confirmed in a similar hereditary authority
over the Senones, which appears to have descended to his brother
Moritasgus from their joint forefathers. Occasionally a number of the
leading states were united in one great confederacy under a temporary
head, chosen for the occasion, who was invested with royal authority
over every member of the alliance, and obedience enforced to his
behests by the exaction of hostages. As war was the bond of union in
such confederacies, the character of the supreme leader was military
not judicial; he was the <i>Toshach</i> not the <i>Vergobreith</i>;
the <i>War-king</i>, exercising the same authority over the whole
confederacy with which every <i>Duke</i> or <i>Toshach</i> was invested
by each member of the alliance over their separate contingents.
Attempts had not been wanting to convert this temporary authority
into a permanent supremacy, as in the case of Celtillus, the father
of Vercingetorix; but Cæsar records no instance of success in a
course of policy which would evidently have laid the foundation of a
wider and far more formidable <i>kingdom</i> than any that had been
established by the mere conversion of the <i>elective</i> into the
<i>hereditary</i> principle within the boundaries of a single state.
In all these features of the government of the greater states of Gaul,
there is nothing that can be considered peculiar to the people of that
country alone. The annual <i>Vergobreith</i> is but the counterpart of
the <i>Princeps</i> chosen in the German assemblies, and dispatched
with a hundred <i>Comites</i> to administer justice amongst the
confederated clans. Aristocratic confederacies, occasionally united
under the rule of one head, or <i>Heretoga</i>, prevailed amongst the
continental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> Saxons in the days of Beda, and probably of Charlemagne;
a judge, perhaps elective, still governed the Visigoths at the close
of the fourth century, when an infant king was the hereditary ruler of
the Ostragoths; whilst Maraboduus is an example that the authority of
a permanent magistrate had occasionally prevailed over the elective
principle amongst the Germans, even before the days of Tacitus, when
the government of a king was not unknown amongst that people.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The true peculiarity of the Celtic system, the “balance of power,” is
to be found in that singular principle of divided authority, which is
surely traceable to the original separation of the two leading classes,
and their mutual jealousy of encroachment, a jealousy which seems to
have settled into a fixed principle of policy in the Celtic system of
government long after its probable cause had been forgotten. Every
state, every group of clans, every family even, was thus divided;
<i>two</i> confederacies took the lead amongst the whole people; and
if the Ædui or the Sequani lost their pre-eminence, the Rhemi or the
Arverni stept into the vacant place; for the undivided supremacy of
<i>one</i> confederacy—<i>un</i>balanced power—would have been
totally contrary to all Celtic precedent.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Three leading characters
are traceable amongst the Gauls,—one hereditary, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> <i>Princeps</i>
or head of the race, the <i>Cen-Cinnitd</i> or <i>Pen-Cenedl</i>
of later times; two elective, the <i>Judex</i>, supreme magistrate
or <i>Vergobreith</i>, and the <i>Dux</i> or <i>Toshach</i>, the
leader of the host. These characters are equally recognisable
amongst the early Germans, amongst whom they were probably known as
the <i>Cyning</i> or <i>Konung</i>, the head of the kindred—the
<i>Lagaman</i> and the <i>Heretoga</i>; and they existed to a recent
date in every Celtic clan long after the elective had given place to
the hereditary principle, as the chief, the <i>Toshach</i>, and the
judge, <i>Brehon</i> or <i>Deempster</i>. As amongst the Germans so
amongst the Gauls, the head of the lineage was not necessarily the
leader of the host, though the offices were not unfrequently united
in the same person. Sedulius was <i>dux et princeps</i> (captain and
chief) of the Lemovices; and Vertiscus “<i>princeps</i>,” or chief of
the confederacy of the Rhemi, was also “<i>præfectus</i>” (captain or
<i>toshach</i>) of their cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But here the resemblance ceases,
for the German <i>Lagaman</i>—the <i>princeps</i> who was elected
in the assembly, and dispatched with a hundred <i>Gasinds</i> or
<i>Comites</i> to judge the people—never appears to have necessarily
laid aside his military authority. Athanaric was <i>Dux</i> as well
as <i>Judex</i> of the Visigoths; and the Frank Gasind of a later
period united in his own person both military and judicial functions,
as <i>Graf</i>, <i>Count</i> or <i>Judex Fiscalis</i>. Such was not
the case amongst the Celts, who appear to have separated the judicial
from the military office—authority from power—with all that jealous
care in which may be traced the anxiety of the original founders of
the system to preserve an equal balance between two rival castes. The
<i>Vergobreith</i> amongst the Ædui was strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> prohibited from
crossing the frontiers of the confederacy,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and was of course
incapacitated from holding the office of <i>Toshach</i> during the
continuance of his supreme magistracy. That this prohibition lasted
only during the year of office is evident from the example of Cotus,
who, failing in his attempt to succeed his brother Vedeliacus as
<i>Vergobreith</i>, appears immediately afterwards as <i>Toshach</i>
of the Æduan cavalry. As the <i>Vergobreith</i> was inaugurated by the
Druids,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and as that class monopolized the whole administration of
the laws, it is very evident that the noble who was chosen for the
supreme magistracy resigned his military character during his year
of office, and was enrolled, as it were, for that period amongst the
ranks of the Druids. Had such a personage existed as a permanent and
hereditary <i>Vergobreith</i> giving law to the whole Celtic race, this
sacred character would have become equally permanent and hereditary,
and the ruler of the Celtic people would have resembled, in this
respect, the monarchs of the great eastern empires of antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The Gauls, however, never appear to have arrived, in historical times,
at the same point of unity in their political, as in their religious,
constitution; and the Hierophant, or Arch-Druid, elected for life,
stood alone, and without any parallel, amongst the equestrian order.
Long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> after the introduction of Christianity, and a thousand years
after the time of Cæsar, the old principle of separating the judicial
from the military functions is still clearly discernible in the
Welsh “Laws of Howel Dha.” Two officers were appointed over every
royal <i>Commot</i>, the <i>Cynghellwr</i> and the <i>Maer</i>, the
former administering justice, the latter collecting the royal dues
and following the king to battle; and the same system is traceable in
Gaelic Scotland, where, under the Teutonic disguise of <i>Thane</i> and
<i>Deempster</i>, it is easy to discover the types of the Cymric Maer
and Cynghellwr.</p>

<p>The Celtic principle of division, or balance of power, is recognisable
amongst the Cymri both in their older confederacies of <i>Deur</i> and
<i>Bryneich</i>, and in the later <i>Gwynnedd</i> and <i>Dyved</i>,
or North and South Wales; but it is in Ireland that the best examples
are afforded of this singular peculiarity of the continual subdivision
of authority. The whole country was divided as usual into North and
South, or <i>Leth Cuin</i> and <i>Leth Mogh</i>, the latter containing
<i>Muimhean</i> and <i>Laighean</i>—Munster and Leinster—each again
subdivided into North and South, or <i>Thomond</i> and <i>Desmond</i>,
<i>Tuath-Laighean</i> and <i>Deas-gabhar</i>. Ulster and Connaught were
the <i>two</i> historical provinces of the north of Ireland, <i>two</i>
kingdoms are traceable in legendary Ulster, and after <i>Uladh</i>
had ceased to share in the sovereignty of the North, <i>two</i>
families, the <i>Dalaraide</i> and <i>Dal-fiatach</i>, long contested
the supremacy within the circumscribed boundaries of the province. No
sooner had the great family of the Hy Nial succeeded in monopolizing
the supreme power than it was at once divided into the usual separate
branches of Northern and Southern Hy Nial, each gradually subdivided
into the clans of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> Eogan and Conal, of Colman and of Aodh Slane. The
predominance of a single race was, as of old, the signal for its
subdivision, even the smallest clan being subject to the divided
authority of a chief and a toshach.</p>

<p>Once every year the Gallic Druids were accustomed to meet in solemn
convention at a spot within the confines of the Carnutes, which was
looked upon as the centre of Gaul, and had there been such a magistrate
as an annual <i>Vergobreith</i> chosen to rule over the whole Gallic
race, it is probable that he would have been inaugurated in this
assembly in the same manner as the Æduan Druids consecrated the
provincial <i>Vergobreith</i>, who ruled for his allotted year over
that confederacy. A similar convention is traceable in Ireland under
the name of the <i>Feas Temora</i>, or “Feast of Tara,” a place chosen
probably for its centrical situation; and he who “held the feast” was
the acknowledged <i>Ardrigh</i> of the whole nation, the “tribes of
Tara” originally holding their lands on condition of quartering the
king and his followers on the occasion of the great festival. This
convention, undoubtedly in its origin a Druidical meeting like the
solemn assembly within the borders of the Carnutes, was still existing
in Ireland in historical times, dying out towards the close of the
seventh century; though the Irish annalists long continued to give the
title of “king of Tara” to the <i>Ardrigh</i>, who claimed the supreme
authority over the whole Irish people.</p>

<p>The invariable Celtic principle of “division” is plainly traceable
amongst the population of Northern Britain in their separation
from a very early period into Caledones and Mæatæ, Dicaledones and
Vecturiones, and latterly into Northern and Southern Picts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> Towards
the middle of the third century, when Dion wrote, the form of their
government was still “democratic;” in other words, the various states
or confederacies into which the Pictish people were divided, like
the early Gauls and Southern Britons, were still ignorant of the
principle of one elective or hereditary ruler.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The earliest bond
of union may probably be traced to the time when they united under
one common leader to resist or assail the Roman legionaries; and out
of the <i>Dux</i> or <i>Toshach</i> elected for the occasion, like
Galgacus, and exercising a paramount though temporary authority, arose
the <i>Ardrigh</i> or supreme king, after some popular or ambitious
chieftain had prolonged his power by successful wars, or procured
his election to this prominent station for life. The nature of the
sovereignty thus established, which was fully recognised in the days
of Columba, resembled the dominion of the Ardrigh amongst the kindred
Gael of Ireland, or of the Unben amongst the earlier Cymri, differing
in a remarkable manner from the royal authority as it existed amongst
the Welsh of a later age. <i>Breith</i>, or <i>Law</i>, was at the
root of the later Welsh system. Privilege was <i>Breint</i>, the noble
or man of privilege amongst the Southern Welsh, <i>Breyr</i>; the
king, <i>Breen-hyn</i>—the senior <i>Brehon</i> or <i>Lawgiver</i>,
the hereditary instead of the elective <i>Vergobreith</i>. In the
laws of Howel Dha, the representative of the Druid, or of the noble
enrolled amongst the Druids, the <i>Cynghellwr</i> who “divided with
the <i>Brenin</i>” evidently took precedence of the <i>Maer</i>, the
representative of the military noble; whilst the <i>Rhy</i>, and
<i>Twysawg</i>, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> <i>Rex</i> and <i>Dux</i> (though met with in the
Welsh dictionaries), are never found in these laws. With the Gael,
however, it was the <i>Righ</i> and the <i>Toshach</i> who were most
prominent; the <i>Brehon</i> had no such intimate connection with the
throne or with the privileged classes, and in the charter of king
Robert Bruce to the Thane of Cawdor, it was the <i>Judex</i> who held
his lands under the Thane or <i>Toshach</i>. The Gaelic <i>Ardrigh</i>
represented the permanent <i>Toshach</i>, not the <i>Vergobreith</i>,
the permanent holder of the office of <i>Vercingetorix</i>, the head of
a wide confederacy bound together less by the ties of blood, or by an
authority confirmed by the sacerdotal order, than by the actual power
of the supreme ruler confirmed by the exaction of hostages.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The different tribes enumerated by Ptolemy, and subsequently known
as the Northern and Southern Picts, appear at some early period to
have coalesced into seven lesser confederacies, answering to the
“Pictish Provinces” of Beda. Allusion is evidently made to these
principalities in the old verses ascribed by tradition to Columba,
enumerating the seven sons of <i>Cruithne</i>—characters of the same
description as the sons of Hellen—“Cait, Ce, Ciric of the hundred
clans, Fiv, Fidach, Fodla, Fortreim.” In <i>Fiv</i> “the forest,”
and in <i>Cait</i>, there is little difficulty in recognising “the
ancient kingdom of Fife,” and a province of which the north-eastern
extremity still retains the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> name of Caith<i>ness</i>, the point or
promontory of <i>Caith</i>. Meaningless alike in Gaelic and in Welsh,
<i>Caith</i> is probably the Celtic form of <i>Ketje</i>, “the end” or
“extremity” in Lappish, a relic of a time when an Ugrian population
regarded this province as their northern limit. The recollection of
<i>Fortreim</i> was long preserved in the Deanery of <i>Fortrev</i> or
<i>Fotheriff</i>, lying along the banks of the Forth, from which river
the name was most probably derived. <i>Fodla</i> or <i>Fotla</i>, a
word sometimes used amongst the Irish Gael as synonymous with Ireland,
or their native home, survives in <i>Athfodla</i> or <i>Atholl</i>;
whilst the appellation of <i>Fidach</i>, or “the woody” may be safely
conjectured to have belonged to that province which was once known
to the Romans under the ancient British epithet of <i>Celydon</i>,
or “the forest district.” No clue remains to identify <i>Ce</i> and
<i>Ciric</i>, which may have answered to the provinces upon the coast
included between the Grampian range and the eastern and northern seas.
Nothing whatever is known of these seven provinces beyond the bare fact
of their existence, though long after they had been broken up into
earldoms, or united by conquest to the possessions of the crown, the
tradition of this ancient sevenfold division of the Pictish kingdom,
and of the rights of the provincial princes in electing a paramount
<i>Ardrigh</i>, appears to have been revived amongst a party of the
Scottish nobles for the purpose of adding to their overgrown power at
the expense of their youthful king.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>The Pictish king was elective, unless he formed an exception to the
universal rule prevailing amongst the Teutonic as well as the Celtic
tribes in early times. The theory of election, indeed, pervaded all
the institutions of the Gaelic people, who seem to have nominally
chosen their heads of houses and chiefs of clans, as well as their
<i>Flaiths</i>, <i>Oirrighs</i>, and <i>Ardrigh</i>, or their princes,
provincial kings, and the supreme ruler of the whole nation. Brother
succeeded to brother upon the throne, and the law of primogeniture,
as amongst the early Germans, was only partially recognised, each
“full-born” son having a claim upon the inheritance of his father,
though the universal custom of “fosterage” led to the same results
as Cambrensis deplored amongst his countrymen in Wales. Each child
was placed in the family of a dependant, who regarded such a charge
as a mark of the highest confidence and honour; and even in the
seventeenth century, men of rank and station in the Scottish Highlands
still esteemed it a privilege to educate in this manner one of
the children of the head of their lineage. The child thus adopted
shared in the property of his foster-father on the same footing as
his foster-brethren, who profited in return from the protection and
support of their more illustrious connection, and thus was formed a tie
which generally proved a far surer bond of union than even the actual
existence of blood relationship. The “fosterers” of the royal race
must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> have invariably been chosen from amongst the greater nobles, each
of whom, from mingled motives of affection and self-interest, was ever
too ready to support the claims of his own foster-son, or <i>Dalt</i>,
upon the supreme power; and the continual contests about the succession
to the throne, which arose in this age in every country in Western
Europe, are traceable less to the inveteracy of fraternal hatred than
to the jealous rivalry of interested partizans, which must have been
engendered by such a system of fosterage. Gradually, however, except in
cases of incapacity, or where one of the junior members of the family
far exceeded the rest in prowess or popularity, the precedency of
the eldest-born grew into the rule, the contrary course becoming the
exception.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Upon the accession of a new monarch, he ascended the Sacred Stone,
preserved inviolate for such occasions, and was inaugurated in the
presence of the clergy and the laity by the principal bishop of the
nation. Originally it is probable that the Druids were the necessary
assistants on such occasions, their prerogatives passing to the clergy;
for Columba is said by his biographer, Adamnan, to have “ordained”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Aidan king of the Dalriads, an expression which cannot mean that
Aidan’s title to the royal dignity was based upon the authority of
the Abbot of Iona, but rather that the sanction of the sacerdotal
order, which appears to have been considered indispensable to all
political authority amongst the Celtic people from time immemorial,
had been transferred upon the fall of the old religion, from the
Druidical to the Christian priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Close to the <i>Ardrigh</i>,
with his right foot planted on the same stone of honour, stood the
<i>Righdomna</i> or <i>Tanist</i>, the heir-apparent of the monarchy,
who seems to have been nominated on the same occasion in pursuance
of the true Celtic principle of “a divided authority,” the office
being immediately filled up, in case of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> premature death of the
<i>Tanist</i> during the lifetime of the reigning sovereign—a fatality
of very frequent occurrence—the same rule being as applicable to the
chieftain of the smallest territory as to the chosen leader of the
nation. The power of the <i>Ardrigh</i> over the provincial kings
must have depended upon his ability to enforce it, and to exact the
hostages which were invariably necessary to secure the obedience of
the subordinate princes. <i>Can</i> and <i>Cuairt</i>, or tribute
and visitation, were amongst his rightful dues; in other words, in
addition to the payment of a stipulated tribute, the <i>Oirrighs</i>
were bound to entertain the <i>Ardrigh</i> and his followers in
his annual progresses for a certain stated period in every year; a
burdensome system of free-quarters by no means peculiar to the Celtic
people, which could be exacted by every petty chieftain from the
occupants of all the territory over which his influence extended.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The authority of the early Pictish kings over the various provinces
of the confederacy was probably identical with that of the Irish
<i>Ardrigh</i> over the subordinate principalities of <i>Leth Cuin</i>
and <i>Leth Mogh</i>, and may be compared to the dominion exercised by
Kent, Wessex, or Mercia, over the remaining South Humbrian kingdoms,
at a time when either state was liable to exchange the situation
of a ruling power for a subordinate and comparatively dependent
position.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>After the union of the two branches of the Pictish nation under one
elective sovereign, the next step in the progress of their amalgamation
was to confirm the preponderance of one state, and thus render the
elective monarchy hereditary in one family. In the attempts to
accomplish this object, which were made by the elder Angus and his
successors, the ancient sevenfold division of the nation appears to
have been broken up and destroyed, and the real conquest of the Pictish
people to have been effected. The tradition of a conquest is far too
strong to allow it to be looked upon as a mere fable, though the
total silence of all the early authorities, and the relative position
of the Picts and the Dalriads render it utterly impossible that the
insignificant tribe of Kintyre, occupying only a very small portion
of the modern county of Argyle, could have conquered and exterminated
the whole remaining population of North Britain beyond the Forth and
Clyde. A very slight acquaintance, however, with early history, where
it borders on the legendary and traditionary periods, will confirm the
truth of the remark, that events which may have really happened are
frequently misplaced and transferred to a wrong epoch, very often owing
their misplacement to a wish to build up the fame of some favourite
hero, by attributing to him the merit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> every important action of
several different periods. Scottish history abounds with instances of
such misplacement, and the Scottish conquest is of the number; but by
keeping strictly to the scanty records left by the annalists who lived
nearest to the period in question, it will be found that the reign of
the elder Angus offers the closest resemblance to an era of victory and
conquest. His annexation of Atholl and the Lennox, of Lorn, and perhaps
also of Kintyre, must have extended his authority to the western coast
of Argyle, whilst his successive victories over three kings of the
Picts appear to have enlarged his frontiers in the opposite direction,
by establishing his predominance over the neighbouring district of
Fife.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The modern shires of Perth, Fife, Stirling, and Dumbarton,
with the greater part of the county of Argyle, may therefore be said
to have formed the actual Scottish kingdom to which Kenneth succeeded,
conquered originally by the elder Angus, and subsequently consolidated
by his successors Constantine and the younger Angus, the union of
the three provinces, of Fife, Atholl, and Fortreim under one family,
paving the way for the permanent supremacy of the princes of the ruling
race over the remaining provincial kings; and as Alpin, the father of
Kenneth, was in later days confounded with the opponent of the elder
Angus, so the triumphs of the latter monarch were gradually transferred
to the earliest prince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> the MacAlpin dynasty after the numerous and
varied tribes who united in acknowledging the supremacy of Kenneth’s
successors had identified their own origin with the Dalriad ancestry of
their line of kings.</p>

<p class="smcap center">The Line of Kintyre:—</p>

<table class="smaller">
  <tr>
    <td class="cht"><i>Kenneth the First</i></td>

</table>

<p>Never were the qualities more needed which earned for the first
Kenneth the title of “the Hardy,” than during the sixteen years of his
turbulent reign; for his kingdom was exposed to hostilities on every
side. The Britons of Strath Clyde burnt Dunblane; the Danes carried
their ravages to Dunkeld in Atholl, and to Cluny in Stormont, and if
Ragnar Lodbroc is not the mere creation of some northern scald, it
was probably under the leadership of that renowned sea-king that they
destroyed the monastery of the Pictish Constantine. The Scottish king
proved equal to the occasion, and six times leading his followers
across the “Scots-water,” he repulsed the Britons, harried the
Lothians, burnt Dunbar, and seized upon Melrose, stifling any doubts
about his claim to the throne in the plunder of the fertile lowlands of
“Saxony.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Iona, during the vicissitudes of this stormy era, had been far too much
exposed to escape the fury of the northern pirates, and the revered
asylum of Columba’s brotherhood, participating in the misfortunes
of Lindisfarne, was deserted at an early period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> under the repeated
attacks of the Pagan foe, neither island ever recovering the importance
that had once attached to their hallowed shores. The destruction of
Dunkeld, which had been destined by its founder to replace both Iona
and Abernethy, gave occasion to the solitary peaceful action attributed
to the Scottish sovereign, who, collecting the relics of Columba from
the localities to which they had been borne for security, enshrined
them in a new church at Dunkeld,<span class="sni">A. D. 849.</span> rebuilding
the monastery on the same spot as had been chosen for the original
foundation. An alliance with the Britons of Strath Clyde, whose prince,
Cu, received the hand of his daughter in marriage, completes the record
of Kenneth’s actions; and ten years after the restoration of Dunkeld he
died in his capital <span class="sni">A. D. 859.</span> of Dunfothir or Forteviot,
the victim of a painful and lingering disease.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Donald MacAlpin succeeded his brother, and for four years filled the
throne of Scotland, nothing being recorded of his short reign with the
exception of a council at Forteviot, in which the “Laws of Aodh the
Fair,” <span class="sni">A. D. 863.</span> of Kintyre, were confirmed by “the Gael”
and their king.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>


<h3><i>Constantine the First</i>, 863–877.</h3>

<p>Constantine, the son of Kenneth, and the first inheritor of the name of
his Pictish ancestor, ascended the throne of Scotland at an era when
the efforts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> Gorm, Eric, and Harald Harfager to consolidate the
petty states of Scandinavia into the respective kingdoms of Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, had given a fresh stimulus to the incursions of
the Vikings upon the British Isles, by dispossessing and driving from
their homes many of the minor chieftains who refused to submit to their
authority. Ireland as well as Britain had suffered from the attacks of
these marauders as early as the close of the eighth century, but it was
not before the middle of the following century that the Northmen first
established themselves permanently in the former country, principally
in Dublin and its neighbourhood, where the recollection of one branch
of the invaders is still retained in the name of the adjacent district
of Fingall.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 850</div>

<p>About ten years after the first settlement of the Norsemen a fresh
fleet arrived off the Irish coasts, under the command of leaders
claiming to belong to “the royal race of Lochlan,” to whom the
native annalists have given the name of Du Gall, or Black Strangers,
in contradistinction to their predecessors the Fin Gall or White
Strangers, epithets which were derived probably from some long
forgotten distinction in dress or armour rather than from any
difference in personal appearance or in nationality.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Driven from
Dublin and from their settlements upon the coast of Uladh, the Fingall
collected in great numbers from every quarter, and soon returned with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
their whole force to re-assert their lost ascendancy; but a combat
between the two fleets, which is said to have lasted during three days
and nights, confirmed the superiority of their rivals, and in the
following year Olave the Fair, the son of Ingiald, an Upland chieftain
of the same race as Harald Harfager, landed with his followers
<span class="sni">A. D. 854.</span> amongst his countrymen, and at once assumed the
lead over all the Northmen of Ireland. In alliance with the Norwegian
Olave was the Danish Ivar or Ingvar, the most renowned warrior amongst
all the northern chieftains, whom tradition has made a son of Ragnar
Lodbroc, and the ruthless avenger of his slaughter.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>For several years after the arrival of the confederates their ravages
were confined to the provinces of Ireland, until at length, in the
same year in which Ivar and Halfdan first established themselves upon
<span class="sni">A. D. 866.</span> the coasts of East Anglia, the storm burst
upon the dominions of Constantine, and from the 1st of January to St.
Patrick’s day, Olave and Auisle carried fire and sword throughout the
region bordering on the Forth. <span class="sni">A. D. 870.</span> After a lapse of
four years Olave again revisited the Scottish shores, and in company
with Ivar laid siege to the rock of Dumbarton, capturing and destroying
the ancient bulwark of the Britons of Strath Clyde after a lengthened
blockade of four months, the sole means available to an unskilful
age against a <i>Dun</i> so strongly situated. The confederates then
marched southwards to join their countrymen in England; once more a
king of Saxon race was sacrificed to the manes of Ragnar, and the fate
of the Northumbrian Elli was inflicted upon the East Anglian martyr
Edmund; nor was it until the close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> of the following year <span class="sni">
A. D. 871.</span> that the allies returned to Dublin laden with the spoil of
the Saxon, the Briton, and the Scot, and leaving behind them a fearful
track of misery and bloodshed to mark the most lengthened and direful
of all their inroads. Olave lost his life shortly afterwards in an
obscure skirmish, fought, according to some accounts, in Scotland; and
the death of Ivar in 873, <span class="sni">A. D. 873.</span> after surviving his
confederate for only a few months, released the Saxon and Scottish
princes from the ablest and most ruthless of their foes.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the earlier opponents of Olave and Ivar in the course of their
Irish wars was a certain Caittil the Fair, <span class="sni">A. D. 857.</span>
probably the same person as Ketil Biornson, who established himself in
independence amongst the islands along the western coasts of Scotland
belonging to the mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic race who were known
under the name of the Gallgael. His daughter Auda was subsequently
married to his former rival Olave, and upon the death of her husband
after his return to Dublin she sought the protection of Ketil in the
Hebrides, whilst her son, Thorstein the Red, early treading in the
footsteps of his father, pursued the career of a Viking.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p>After the establishment of the power of Harald Harfager by the
successful battle of Hafursfiord, many of his vanquished opponents
fled to the Orkneys and the Shetland isles, periodically infesting the
Norwegian coasts in revenge for their defeat and expulsion; and to
put an end to these piratical inroads Harald at length fitted out a
numerous fleet, devoting an entire summer to extirpating the hostile
Vikings from the creeks and bays in which they sought shelter from
his vengeance. In one of the numerous conflicts occurring during this
expedition, Ivar, a son of Harald’s favourite and most trusted friend
Rognwald, Jarl of Mœri, lost his life, and as some compensation for
the death of his son the king bestowed his own conquests upon the
father. Rognwald, however, preferring to return to his Norwegian
home, transferred the royal donation to his brother Sigurd, who was
accordingly confirmed as Jarl, and left behind, on the departure of the
king, in possession of the Orkneys and the Shetland isles.</p>

<p>Not content with his newly acquired island territories Jarl Sigurd
was ambitious of a wider dominion, and entering into an alliance with
Thorstein Olaveson, the confederates employed their united force in
invading the northern provinces of Scotland. The whole of the country
as far as the banks of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> Oikel,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> embracing the modern counties of
Caithness and Sutherland, was overrun and conquered by the allies, two
Scottish magnates falling in an unavailing resistance; Meldun, whose
wife, the daughter of an Irish king, became with her son the slave of
Auda,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> affording in their altered fortunes a striking example of the
strange vicissitudes of the age; and Malbride “with the buck-tooth,”
whose singular fate—if the Saga can be relied upon—avenged him after
death upon the author of his misfortunes. Sigurd is said to have slain
the last-named chieftain in single combat, and with the savage ferocity
of the times to have cut off the head of his victim, suspending it in
triumph from his saddle-bow, in which position the projecting tooth of
the slaughtered chieftain is supposed to have inflicted so severe a
wound upon the Jarl’s leg as ultimately to cause his death, and he was
buried by his followers upon the banks of the Oikel, at the extreme
limits of his conquests.</p>

<p>Though deprived of his ally, the Jarl of Orkney, Thorstein failed
not to follow up his success, and whilst victory attended the banner
of the king of the Dugall in the extreme north, the difficulties
of Constantine must have been materially increased by the inroads
of Halfdan <span class="sni">A. D. 875.</span> upon his opposite frontiers, who
established himself in Northumbria during the same year, and made
incessant incursions upon the neighbouring “Picts” and Britons.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> A
decisive defeat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> at Dollar, on the borders of Perthshire and Fife, at
length forced the Scottish king to submit to the alternative imposed at
a later period upon both the English Edmunds, the whole of the northern
provinces were made over to the son of Olave, and Constantine purchased
a temporary peace at the price of half of his dominions.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The success of Thorstein was destined to be ephemeral, the very year of
his triumph witnessing the close of his adventurous career. Attacked
unexpectedly by the followers of Constantine, he appears to have
fallen in an unequal contest; Halfdan was driven from his Northumbrian
conquests, perishing soon afterwards in Ireland, and the death of
Sigurd’s son Guttorm delivering his father’s earldom once more into the
hands of the independent Vikings, the power of the Norsemen was broken
up for a time, and the threatening cloud which had loured so darkly
over Scotland melted away from the horizon.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 877.</div>

<p>But the career of Constantine was also approaching its conclusion, and
he had little time to profit by the events which had released him from
his enemies. As his whole reign had been passed in a continual struggle
to protect his country from the Northmen, so it was at length closed
with honour on the battle-field in repulsing a hostile landing upon the
coast of Fife; though tradition has hinted at a darker tale, that after
repelling with success the enemy’s attack he was captured by a party of
the retreating Norsemen, and sacrificed by a lingering and cruel death
in the gloomy recesses of the Black Cave near Crail.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the British Islands, as indeed in every quarter to which the
Norsemen penetrated, a change may be dated from their earliest
incursions; and whilst in Ireland they broke the power of the Hy Nial,
and taught the dynasties of Munster and of Connaught to aspire to the
supremacy which had hitherto been the undisputed prerogative of the
princely families of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> Ulster and of Meath; in England the remnants
of independent sovereignty were overwhelmed and swallowed up in the
flood, the line of Cerdic in Wessex, which alone was strong enough to
bear up against the torrent, becoming from that very cause the sole
representative in the eyes of the Saxon people of the ancient royalty
of their race. Scotland, where the monarchy, though of comparatively
recent date, was destined eventually to survive the crisis, appeared
towards the close of the ninth century to be fast verging towards
the fate of Ireland; for though Thorstein perished before his power
was consolidated, the cession of the northern provinces to that
enterprising sea-king revived the recollection of former independence,
and many years elapsed before the authority of the Scottish kings
was once more successfully asserted over the ancient territories
of the northern Picts. On the accession of Aodh, or Hugh, the
surviving son of Kenneth, his pretensions were disputed by Cyric—or
Grig—MacDungal, a chieftain whose residence at Dundurn, or Dunadeer,
in the Garioch, marks his pre-eminence amongst the northern magnates
whose allegiance had been transferred to Thorstein.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The contest for
superiority between north and south was decided in the neighbourhood
of Strathallan, the locality of the battle-field, <span class="sni">A. D.
878.</span> within the dominions of Aodh, appearing to point to Cyric as
the aggressor: victory declared in favour of the northern leader,
and his opponent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> wounded and a prisoner, was conveyed for security
to the fortress of Inverury, where he died of his wounds after a few
weeks’ captivity. Either the victor was content with asserting his own
independence, or policy may have prevented him from aspiring to the
vacant throne; for he appears to have been satisfied with reviving
the divided sovereignty of former times; and by associating in the
government a scion of the royal race of Kenneth, Eocha of Strath Clyde,
a son of the British prince Cu, he may have sought to propitiate the
hostile chieftains of the south, whilst the real authority over both
kingdoms must have remained with the conqueror of Strathallan.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Similar motives may possibly have dictated the benefaction to the
church of St. Andrews, which has caused the name of Cyric to be handed
down in the register of the ancient priory as “the Liberator of the
Scottish Church, which had hitherto remained in a dependant and
subservient position, according to the prevailing custom of the Picts.”
The boon thus vaguely recorded by the grateful monks of the priory
appears to have been nothing more than the transfer of the privileges
which had latterly belonged to Dunkeld to the monastery endowed by
the younger Angus; and St. Andrews, a diocese of the southern Picts,
and often known in later days as pre-eminently the “bishopric of the
Scots,” owed her primacy over the other Scottish bishoprics to the
donation of a prince of the northern provinces.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 889.</div>

<p>Upon the death of Eocha after an eventless career of eleven years,
Donald, the son of Constantine, assumed his cousin’s place, and for
seven years shared with Cyric the supreme authority over Scotland, on
the same terms, apparently, as his predecessor the British prince. A
decisive victory over a body of the Northmen, who were defeated at
Collin on the banks of the Tay, signalized the commencement of the new
reign, avenging the destruction of the Scottish capital of Forteviot,
burnt by the invaders in the course of their inroads; and as the
situation of the ruined town must have exposed it to the attacks of
the pirates of the western seas, it appears to have been abandoned
from this period, and the residence of the sovereign being transferred
for security to the eastern bank of the Tay, the dignity of “the Royal
City” belonged henceforth to Scone.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The few remaining years of the century passed away without events—none
at least have been recorded—Cyric died peacefully at Dunadeer after
a <span class="sni">A. D. 896.</span> reign of eighteen years, and it was left for
the chroniclers of a later age to encircle his memory with a halo of
fabulous glory, and to oppose his triumphs, as the conqueror of England
and Ireland, to the pretensions founded by the first Edward upon the
exploits of the British Arthur.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> No successor arose amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Northern Picts to emulate the policy of their departed leader, and
Scotland, gradually recovering from the shock of Thorstein’s conquests,
ceased for ever after the death of Cyric to be subject to a divided
authority. Henceforth Donald ruled without a rival during the brief
remainder of his reign; but though no competitor appeared from beyond
the Grampian range to assert his equality with the representative of
Constantine and Kenneth, the recollection of their early independence
long survived in full force amongst the northern clans, and a continual
struggle between the divisions of the ancient Pictish kingdom can
still be traced after the lapse of centuries. The death of Donald,
<span class="sni">A. D. 900.</span> who survived Cyric for only four years, would
appear to have been brought about through this inveterate feud, for
he is supposed to have been killed in the town of Forres, and he may
have lost his life in the hostile province of Moray in attempting to
re-establish the royal authority over the revolted districts of the
north.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE THIRD.<br>
<span class="subhed sm">CONSTANTINE THE SECOND—A. D. 900-943.</span></h2></div>

<p>On the death of Donald, by the singular law of alternate succession
which was in force amongst the Gaelic people, the son and
representative of Aodh was raised to the throne as Constantine the
Second; and, with better fortune than his father, the earlier years
of his reign were signalized by a brilliant victory. A body of the
Northmen, who appear, as usual, to have landed from Ireland or the
Western Isles, <span class="sni">A. D. 903.</span> and to have chosen Fortreim as
the scene of their ravages, were defeated in Strathearn with great
slaughter, and with the loss of their leader Ivar hy Ivar, <span class="sni">
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 904.</span> a grandson of the famous Northman of the same
name, whose family had been recently expelled from their Irish
possessions.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Released by his victory from all fear of further
invasion, Constantine seems to have turned his attention towards
regulating the affairs of the Church, for his next appearance is upon
the Moot-hill of Scone, a well-known eminence in the neighbourhood of
the new capital, where, in conjunction with Fothadh, the bishop of St.
Andrews, he presided at the earliest ecclesiastical council recorded
in the annals of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> A far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> more important object, however,
in its ulterior consequences, was accomplished shortly afterwards by a
bloodless revolution, which enabled him to take the first steps towards
enlarging his kingdom on her southern frontiers, and to place a member
of his own family upon the throne of an adjacent principality.</p>

<p>An occasional brief entry in the early chronicles reveals the anxiety
of the rulers of the Picts and Scots to avail themselves of the gradual
decline of the Northumbrian power for the purpose of extending their
own influence over the neighbouring province of Strath Clyde. Some
such motives may have instigated Kenneth to seek for his daughter the
alliance of a British prince; and a few years later, the death of
Artga, king of Strath Clyde, which is attributed by the Irish annalists
to the intrigues of Constantine the First,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 871.</span>
may have been connected with the same policy of aggrandizement, and
have furthered the claims of Eocha, the son of Constantine’s sister.
The advancement of Eocha to the <span class="sni">A. D. 878.</span> Scottish throne
was shortly followed by important consequences to his native province,
and after the flight and death of the Welsh prince Rydderch ap Mervyn
had deprived the northern Britons of one of their firmest supporters,
a considerable body of the men of Strath Clyde, relinquishing the
ancient country of their forefathers, set out, under a leader of the
name of Constantine, to seek another home amongst a kindred people
in the south. Constantine fell at Lochmaben in attempting to force
a passage through Galloway; but his followers, undismayed at their
loss, persevered in their enterprise, arriving in time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> to assist the
Northern Welsh at the great battle of the Conway, where they won the
lands, <span class="sni">A. D. 880</span> as the reward of their valour, which are
supposed to be occupied by their descendants at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>With the retreating emigrants, the last semblance of independence
departed from the Britons of the north; and upon the death of their
king Donald, who was probably a descendant of Kenneth’s daughter,
Constantine the Second experienced little difficulty in procuring the
election of his own brother Donald to fill the vacant throne.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
<span class="sni">A. D. 908.</span> Henceforth a branch of the MacAlpin family
supplied a race of princes to Strath-Clyde; and although for another
hundred years the Britons of that district remained in a state of
nominal independence, they ceased to exist as a separate people,
appearing, on a few subsequent occasions, merely as auxiliaries in the
armies of the Scottish kings.</p>

<p>Fifteen years after his victory over Ivar in Strathearn, Constantine
was called upon for the last time to oppose an inroad of the Northmen.
At the beginning of the tenth century by far the most celebrated of all
the northern leaders were the Hy Ivar or grandsons of Ivar, and sons,
apparently, of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> daughter of that chieftain married to a Scottish
Viking, who seems to have succeeded Ketil in the dominion of Inch Gall
or the Hebrides. Driven from Dublin after its capture by the Irish
king Malfinan, in 902, they appear, like Thorstein, to have sought the
shelter of the Western Isles; and it was owing probably to the loss
of their Irish possessions that they attempted, under the command of
the younger Ivar, to establish themselves upon the Scottish coasts in
903, from whence, as has been already stated, they were expelled in the
following <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>year.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 904.</span></p>

<p>Ten years passed away before the Hy Ivar again appear on the scene.
Reginald, who had now succeeded to the leadership of the family,
defeated and destroyed the fleet of a rival Viking, Barith MacNocti,
<span class="sni">A. D. 914.</span> in an engagement off the Isle of Man; and from
the date of this victory the Norsemen again began to collect upon the
Irish coasts, arriving every year in increasing numbers. Three years
later, Reginald, known by this time as king of the Dugall, landed at
Waterford <span class="sni">A. D. 917.</span> to assume the command, whilst his
brother Sitric, appearing upon the coasts of Leinster, soon succeeded
in re-establishing the power of his family over their former dependency
of Dublin; and in the following year Reginald and his brother Godfrey,
with the Jarls Ottir and Gragraba, who seem to have recently returned
from an unsuccessful inroad upon the coast of Wales, leaving the
harbour of Waterford, sailed for the northern shores of England to
assert the claim of the king of the Dugall as heir of his kinsman, the
Danish Halfdan, to the fertile lands of Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 918.</div>

<p>Landing amongst the kindred Danes of the north, as a welcome auxiliary
against the increasing power of Ethelfleda, Reginald marched at once
upon York, seizing upon, and portioning out amongst his followers and
allies, the whole of the sacred patrimony of St. Cuthbert, with many
a broad acre besides.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> Edred, whose wide possessions reached to the
Derwent, the son of that Rixinc who for three years had ruled the
Northumbrian Angles under the dominion of the Danes, together with
Aldred of Bamborough and his brother Uchtred, sons of Eardulf, of the
old Bernician race, and lords of a territory extending from the Tyne to
the Forth, abandoning their dominions at the approach of the Norsemen,
implored the aid of the Scottish Constantine to stem the torrent of
invasion. In Constantine they found a prompt ally, and strengthened by
the support of a Scottish army, the Northumbrian leaders prepared, with
renewed courage, to march against the foe.</p>

<p>The hostile armies met upon the moor near Corbridge-on-Tyne, where
Reginald, who had decided upon awaiting the attack of the confederates,
holding his immediate followers in reserve in a position where they
were concealed from the assailants, had ranged the main body of his
army in three divisions, under the command respectively of his brother
Godfrey, the two Jarls, and the chieftains to whom the Irish annalist
gives the title of “the Young Leaders.” So impetuous was the onset
of the Scots and Northumbrians, that at the first shock the Norsemen
were overthrown, the heaviest loss falling upon the followers of the
Jarls, a contingency upon which Reginald had probably calculated, as
they bore the brunt of the battle. Animated at their success, and
anxious to improve their advantage, the allies pressed eagerly onwards,
regardless of the enemy’s reserve, which Reginald now poured upon the
flank and rear of the victors, disordered in the confusion of pursuit,
inflicting, in his turn, severe loss, and retrieving the fortune of
the day. Edred was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> slain in this final struggle, with many of his
Northumbrian followers, who appear to have suffered most severely,
until the approach of night separated the combatants, and put a stop to
a contest which led to no decisive result. As the Norsemen remained in
possession of their conquests, the historian of Durham mourns over a
defeat which left the patrimony of the bishopric a prey to the heathen
invaders. The Scottish chronicler claims the battle for a victory,
neither king nor Mormaor falling in the engagement, and no hostile
Norsemen penetrating to the banks of the “Scots-water;” and as no
portion of the territories of Aldred to the northward of the Tyne was
occupied by the followers of Reginald, the advance of the enemy beyond
that river must have been effectually prevented; and Constantine and
his surviving confederate had good reason to be satisfied with the
successful issue of the engagement.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The result of the battle of Corbridge-on-Tyne secured Reginald in
his conquest of Danish Northumbria, where he was succeeded, upon his
death, about three years later, by his brother Sitric, the Irish
possessions <span class="sni">A. D. 921.</span> of the family reverting to Godfrey,
who hastened to establish himself in Dublin.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The alliance of the
new ruler of the Northumbrian Danes was courted by the neighbouring
princes, and Athelstan, soon after his accession to the English
throne, <span class="sni">A. D. 926.</span> bestowed his sister’s hand upon the
powerful chieftain of the Norsemen; though upon the unexpected death
of Sitric, who only survived this union for a few months, dying in
the prime of life in 927, <span class="sni">A. D. 927.</span> the Saxon prince
seized upon the opportunity for asserting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> his own authority over
the province, annexing it at once to the English crown.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Olave
Sitricson, the youthful son of the deceased king, escaped across the
sea to Ireland; but Godfrey, who had quitted Dublin upon hearing of
his brother’s death, endeavoured to enlist the co-operation of his
ancient antagonist the Scottish king in an attempt to dispute the
claims of Athelstan. Constantine, however, was not to be won over, and
as the former supporter of the Northumbrian Saxons still preferred the
alliance of the English king to a hazardous confederacy with the Danish
adventurer, Godfrey, after a vain attempt to establish himself in York,
once more left the English shores and returned to rule over the Irish
Norsemen.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>The subsequent union of Olave Sitricson<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> with a daughter of the
Scottish king endangered that alliance between the two princes which
Godfrey had failed to disturb, and from this moment Constantine became
an object of suspicion to his southern neighbour. <span class="sni">A. D.
934.</span> The unwonted spectacle of an English army appeared before long
upon the Forth; and though the whole of this interesting epoch in the
annals of Saxon England is enveloped in uncertainty and confusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
from the coincidence of this expedition with the death of Godfrey
in Ireland, it may be conjectured that it was the policy of the
English king to prevent any movement on the part of his former ally
Constantine, in support of the claims of Olave, now the head of the
Hy Ivar family, upon the Northumbrian possessions of his father’s
family. Fortreim, as usual, was the suffering province, and the army of
Athelstan, penetrating as far as Forteviot, the ancient capital, wasted
the country in every direction, whilst a powerful fleet, sweeping the
coast to the distant shores of Caithness, prevented the arrival of any
assistance from Ireland. The limits of the incursion were now reached;
and by frustrating the projects of Constantine and his new allies,
its object was probably attained, though the success of Athelstan was
merely temporary, and three years later the storm, which had thus been
averted for a season, burst in all its fury on the English coasts.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 937.</div>

<p>At the head of the confederacy which was now combining to wrest
Northumbria from the grasp of Athelstan, were Constantine and the two
Olaves, the great-grandsons of the Danish Ivar, one of whom, the son
of Sitric, was the son-in-law of the Scottish king, and the other, the
son of Godfrey, had succeeded his father three years previously in the
government of the Irish Norsemen.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> A British prince, to whom the
Saga gives the name of Adills, a chieftain probably of the northern
Welsh, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> with Yring, a Norseman from his name, though described
by the same authority as also of British race, joined the ranks of
Athelstan’s opponents, and Eogan, the son of the Scottish Donald, in
obedience to his allegiance to his kinsman and chief, led his followers
from the vale of Clyde to swell the numbers of the allies. To aid in
opposing this formidable array, Athelstan had invoked the assistance
of the Vikings, and the pagan rovers of the German Ocean now marched
side by side in the English host with the Angles of Mercia, the Saxons
of Wessex, and the Christian descendants of Guthrum’s Danes. The
advantage at first leant to the side of the invaders, for in spite
of his preparations for the impending contest, Athelstan appears to
have been partly taken by surprise. Alfgar and Godric, his lieutenants
in Northumbria, were either driven from the field or slain, and the
English king was reduced to negociate with the enemy in order to
gain time for the union of his whole force. The negociations were
quickly broken off when the required end was attained, and after the
failure of a night attack, skilfully planned by Olave Sitricson, who
is said to have visited the camp of Athelstan in the disguise of a
wandering harper, the rival armies met upon the long-forgotten site of
Brunanburgh. The victors alone have described that celebrated battle;
and whilst the Saga, forgetful alike of the English and Scottish kings,
awards the palm to the Norsemen in the pay of Athelstan, the ancient
ballad in the Saxon Chronicle extols the deeds of the native warriors,
and renders full justice to the valour of Constantine and Olave. Five
kings and seven Jarls, a son of Constantine, and two brothers of
Athelstan, were left amongst the slain upon the field of Brunanburgh;
and whilst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> baffled survivors of the Irish Norsemen returned in
their galleys to Dublin, and the remnants of the Scots with their
sorrowing king mournfully withdrew beyond the Forth, the unchallenged
dominion of the whole of Saxon England, the submission of the Welsh and
of the Northumbrian Danes, and the alliance and admiration of Flanders,
France, and Germany, rewarded the victor of this glorious day.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the battle of Brunanburgh, Eric of the Bloody Axe, the
favourite son of Harald Harfager, and his successor in the Norwegian
kingdom, appeared with a numerous fleet off the northern coasts of
England. Driven from his native country by his half-brother Hakon,
after a reign of less than a year, in which brief space he had
contrived to incur the unanimous hatred of his people, he was now
seeking another theatre for the display of the same qualities which
had already lost him his paternal inheritance; and Athelstan, either
unwilling to provoke so soon the chances of another conflict, or
anxious to raise up in Eric a rival to the pretensions of the Hy Ivar,
welcomed the banished prince as an ally, reminded him of the friendship
existing of old between himself and his late father Harfager, and
offered him an asylum in his own dominions, if he would undertake to
hold the Danish province against the Olaves. Eric readily consented
to the arrangement, and according to the account of the Norwegian
Heimskringla such was the origin of his earliest connection with the
Anglo-Danes of Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>It was destined, in the first instance, to be transitory, for upon
the death of Athelstan, the Northmen, refusing to acknowledge his
successor, chose Olave of Ireland for their king; and the two Olaves,
again uniting their forces, and with better success, relinquished their
Irish home, and forced from the brother of Athelstan the cession of the
whole of his dominions <span class="sni">A. D. 940.</span> to the north of Watling
Street.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Eric attempted no resistance, but sailing away with his
followers, he entered upon a course of piracy which carried him before
long to the Western Isles, from whence he drove out a son of Reginald
Hy Ivar, who was little prepared for so unexpected an attack.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Two
years after the death of Athelstan Olave Godfreyson <span class="sni">A. D.
941.</span> followed him to the grave, losing his life in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> some obscure
skirmish near Tyningham, when Reginald Godfreyson, succeeding to his
brother, shared the supremacy over the north of England with the
survivor of the two Olaves.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>As no allusion is made to Constantine in connection with the second
expedition of the Olaves, it must remain a matter of conjecture whether
any assistance on his part contributed to its successful issue; though
the previous career of the Scottish king, as well as his conduct on
a subsequent occasion, might almost warrant such a supposition. The
remembrance of Brunanburgh, however, may possibly have deterred him
from such a step, and by this time age and its accompanying infirmities
must have begun to weigh heavily upon the venerable monarch; for nearly
seventy years had now elapsed since the death of his father Aodh. It
was an era in which the sword in a vigorous hand was necessary for
the defence of the crown; and Constantine may have been actuated by
prudent motives when he resigned the sceptre before it slipped from his
grasp, and retiring to the seclusion of the monastery of St. Andrews,
<span class="sni">A. D. 943.</span> relinquished the cares and duties of his kingdom
to assume the office of abbot.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Throughout a reign extending over forty years and upwards, Constantine
wielded his authority with vigour, if not always with success, and
even in his declining years maintained the reputation of a valiant and
experienced warrior. The most important event in his career, and that
which exercised the greatest influence over the future prospects of
his kingdom, was the establishment of a branch of his own family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> over
the British principality of Strath Clyde, as it unquestionably tended
to the gradual amalgamation of the inhabitants of that district with
their more numerous and powerful Scottish neighbours, and prepared
the way for the permanent annexation of the province during the reign
of Malcolm II. In his efforts to assist another member of his family
in obtaining a footing in Danish Northumbria he was not equally
successful; but though his connection with Olave Sitricson embroiled
him with the warlike Athelstan, it relieved his kingdom from the
incursions of the Northmen, for with the exception of the contests
which arose in later times between the Jarls of Orkney (a different
race from the Hy Ivar), and the lords of the northern provinces—a
rivalry which incidentally tended to strengthen the authority of the
Scottish kings at the expense of their too powerful dependants—no
further allusion is made to the attacks of the Scandinavians beyond an
occasional and isolated inroad upon the eastern coasts of Scotland.
The contemporary of four of the Anglo-Saxon kings, Constantine, during
the course of his lengthened and chequered reign, was a witness of
momentous changes; the enemies of his youth and manhood became the firm
allies of his later years, and the neighbouring monarchy, which had
been rescued from ruin by the genius of the great Alfred, strengthened
by the steady policy of Edward and his talented sister, and raised
to an unexampled pitch of glory by the energy and valour of the
indomitable Athelstan, threatened, before the close of his eventful
career, to relapse into its original disunion when no longer upheld
by the arm of the mightiest warrior who ever sat upon the throne of
Saxon England. The dynasty of Wessex, indeed, survived the crisis;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> but
the permanent settlement of the Northmen during these reigns, in the
southern division of ancient Northumbria, introduced a foreign element
between Bernicia and the Southumbrian provinces, thus preventing the
consolidation of the Anglo Saxon kingdom, and contributing materially
to the success of those incessant encroachments of the Scottish kings
upon the Northumbrian Saxons, which were only checked by the Norman
Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>


<h3><i>Malcolm the First.</i> 943–954.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 943.</div>

<p>Malcolm, the first of his name, and a son of the second Donald,
succeeded to the authority relinquished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> by his venerable kinsman,
whilst the brother of Athelstan step by step was winning back the
territories ceded to the Northmen at the commencement of his reign. The
great Mercian confederacy of “the Five Burghs” was first reduced to
submission, and Northumbria ere long again acknowledging the authority
of the English king, <span class="sni">A. D. 944.</span> Olave Sitricson abandoned
the province, driving Blacar Godfreyson out of Dublin, and establishing
his authority over the Irish Norsemen, whilst his confederate Reginald,
Blacar’s brother, disappears from history, and Edmund, released from
his Danish foes, was at liberty to turn his arms against Cumberland.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Much confusion has arisen from the ambiguous use of the appellations
of Cumbria and Cumberland. The former name was undoubtedly applied
at one time to a wide extent of country stretching at least from
Dumbartonshire to North Wales, from which district it was early
separated when the greater part of modern Lancashire was added to
the Northumbrian dominions. A little later the grants of Egfrid to
St. Cuthbert must have severed the modern counties of Cumberland and
Westmoreland from the northern Cumbria or Strath Clyde, which was still
further curtailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> by the settlements of the Angles in the diocese of
Candida Casa, a district of which the greater part, if not the whole,
had by this time probably fallen into the hands of the ancestors of the
Picts of Galloway.</p>

<p>Southern Cumbria or Cumberland does not appear to have been included
amongst the conquered districts recovered by the Britons after the
defeat and death of Egfrid at the battle of Nectan’s Mere. When Eardulf
the bishop carried off the relics of St. Cuthbert and St. Oswald from
the profane violence of a pagan as fierce as Penda, the most trusted
companion of his hurried flight was Edred, the Saxon Abbot of Carlisle;
and there is little reason to doubt that at this time the descendants
of the men who won the land in the days of Egfred still peopled the
broad acres granted to the monastery of St. Cuthbert. Forty years later
it is told how Edred, the son of Rixinc, the foremost chieftain amongst
the nobility of Deira, rode “westward over the hills,” slew the Lord
Eardulf, a prince of the Bernician race of Ida, carried off his wife
“in spite of the Frith and the people’s wishes,” and held forcible
possession of territories reaching from Chester le Street to the
Derwent, till he lost both lands and life in the battle of Corbridge
Moor.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> All these names are genuine Saxon, and though the original
British population may still have lingered amidst the lakes and
mountains of their picturesque region, it may be safely doubted whether
they paid either tribute or submission to the Scoto-British prince who
yet retained some vestiges of authority over the fertile valley of the
Clyde; and whilst Scottish Cumbria or Strath Clyde continued under
the rule of a branch of the MacAlpin family from the opening of the
tenth century till the reign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span> of Malcolm the Second, English Cumbria
or Cumberland, when it was not under the authority of the Northumbrian
earls, in whose province it was included, may be said to have remained
in a state of anarchy till the conquest.</p>

<p>The numerous lakes of the latter district, and its situation upon the
north-western coast of England, must have offered at this time an
admirable retreat to the Vikings from Ireland and the Islands; and
Edmund, after clearing the province of these dangerous intruders,
<span class="sni">A. D. 945.</span> made it over to the Scottish king, on condition
that Malcolm should become his faithful “fellow-worker” or ally, by
land and sea.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Upon the death of Edmund, the same arrangement was
renewed with his successor Edred, when he received the submission of
the Northumbrian Danes; <span class="sni">A. D. 948.</span> and when Eric attempted
to re-establish himself in York,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> he received no assistance from
Malcolm, and was hardly chosen king before he was again driven from the
province.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The case was different in the following year, when Olave
Sitricson returned for the last time <span class="sni">A. D. 949.</span> to claim
the inheritance of his father; for though the Scottish king was bound
by his oath to be faithful to his alliance with Edred, the weight of
years had not yet quenched the fire of his aged predecessor, nor had
the peaceful life of the cloistered monk obliterated the recollections
of the soldier. Roused at the approach of his relative and ancient
ally, Constantine, to satisfy the scruples of his kinsman, resumed for
a time the sceptre he had relinquished, and forgetting the abbot in the
king, he once more led his countrymen against the foe, and they long
recounted with exultation and pride how royally their veteran leader
swept the patrimony of St. Cuthbert to the distant borders of the Tees.
Returning in triumph from his successful foray, the warrior-abbot
resigned for the last time his ephemeral authority, and again assuming
the character of a churchman, ended his days three years later, within
the walls of the monastery of St. Andrews.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 952.</div>

<p>In the year in which his aged predecessor at length sunk to rest,
Malcolm, uniting with the Saxons and Britons, opposed an inroad of the
Northmen, and on this occasion he may have faithfully fulfilled the
compact which he appears formerly to have evaded. The Northmen were
victorious over the united forces of the allies, and the result of the
battle probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> re-established Eric in Danish Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> His
arrival was fatal to the supremacy of Olave, who, quitting England for
the last time, settled finally in Dublin, where he soon acquired an
ascendency surpassing that of all his predecessors, establishing his
family as the rulers of the Irish Norsemen, and exacting hostages and
levying tribute over the whole extent of Ireland, from the Shannon to
the sea. <span class="sni">A. D. 980.</span> For nearly thirty years his power was
unbroken, until the decisive victory of Tara first re-established the
superiority of the native Irish, which the more celebrated but less
important battle of Clontarf <span class="sni">A. D. 1014.</span> was destined
subsequently to confirm. Olave, who was not present at the battle, did
not long survive its issue. The spirit of the aged Northman was broken
by the death of many of his sons, and relinquishing his authority
to Sitric, one of the survivors, he quitted the scene of his former
triumphs, and the last days of the most formidable opponent of the
great Athelstan were passed in the seclusion of Iona.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Long before
the death of Olave, the career of his rival Eric had been brought to
a close. Driven from Northumbria after a reign of only two years, he
appears to have fallen in a skirmish on Stanemoor, slain by Magnus
Haraldson, through the treachery of Osulf, who was rewarded with the
Eorldordom of Northumbria, whilst Man and the Hebrides fell to the
share of Magnus.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 954.</div>

<p>Two years after the death of Constantine, Malcolm followed him to the
grave. He was slain at Ulurn, not far from Forres, in the vicinity of
the same spot where his father had perished upwards of half a century
previously. The northern districts appear to have been peculiarly fatal
to this branch of the reigning family, and Malcolm’s death may probably
be attributed to the vengeance of the men of Mærne, for the death of
Cellach, a northern Mormaor, whose defeat in the earlier years of the
king’s reign is amongst the occasional vague notices in the Scottish
chronicles, which alone remain to shed a dim light upon the incessant
contest waged for many generations between the northern and southern
provinces of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Three kings followed in the usual alternate succession during the next
seventeen years, half of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> period being comprised in the reign of
Indulf, the son of Constantine the Second. The grant of Cumberland was
not renewed, either on account of the distracted state of England after
the death of Edred, or possibly because of the somewhat doubtful manner
in which the former king fulfilled his engagements, and the connection
of his successor with the still formidable ruler of the Dublin
Norsemen; but the loss of the English province was soon compensated by
the capture of Edinburgh, the first known step in the progress of the
gradual extension of the Scottish kingdom between the Forth and Tweed.
A century previously the jurisdiction of the successor of St. Cuthbert
still reached as far as Abercorn upon the Forth, but henceforth it was
bounded by the Pentland hills until about fifty years later, when the
historian of Durham has to record a more important loss, and to mourn
over the contraction of the diocese within still narrower limits.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Twice was Indulf called upon to repel the inroads of the Northmen, who
appear to have crossed the eastern seas, and endeavoured to effect a
landing upon the coasts of Buchan and Banff. On both occasions he was
successful, driving the invaders to their ships, the latest victory,
however, costing him his life, for he fell in opposing the descent of
the Norsemen at Invercullen.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>Sufficient time had now elapsed since the accession of the Dalriad
princes to the throne of Scotland to develope the principle of division
inseparable from the Gaelic system of government, each branch of
Kenneth’s family endeavouring, after the lapse of a few generations,
to shut out the other from the throne, and to monopolize the right
to the alternate succession as the exclusive prerogative of their
own peculiar line. Accordingly the reign of Duff, the eldest son of
Malcolm the First, and representative of the senior branch of the royal
family, appears to have been passed in a continual struggle against
the pretensions raised by the now rival line of Aodh in the person of
Indulf’s son Colin, and though at first successful, defeating Colin at
the battle of Duncrub, <span class="sni">A. D. 965.</span> in which the Mormaor of
Atholl and the Abbot of Dunkeld, partizans apparently of the defeated
prince, were numbered amongst the slain,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> he was subsequently less
fortunate, and was driven by his rival from the throne, losing his life
on a later occasion at Forres, a place so disastrous to every member
of his family, where his body is said to have been hidden under the
bridge of Kinloss, <span class="sni">A. D. 967.</span> tradition adding that the sun
refused to shine until the dishonoured remains of the murdered monarch
received the burial of a king.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>An uneventful reign of four or five years is assigned to his successor
Colin, terminated as usual upon the field of battle, where he is said
to have fallen with his brother Eocha in a battle fought against the
Britons of Strath Clyde. <span class="sni">A. D. 971.</span> Such at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> is
the account left by the earlier authorities, though he is generally
represented in the pages of later chronicles as the victim of private
revenge, assassinated in the Lothians by Andarch MacDonald, a British
prince, who avenged in the blood of the king an insult offered to his
daughter.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="subhed"><span class="smcap">Kenneth the Second</span>—971–995.</span></h2></div>

<p>No opposition seems to have been offered upon the death of Colin
to another son of Malcolm the First, <span class="sni">A. D. 971.</span> who
ascended the throne as Kenneth the Second; though the subsequent
death of Colin’s brother Olave, about six years later, may point to a
continuance of the struggle between the rival branches of the reigning
family, and appears to have established Kenneth for the remainder
of his life in undisputed possession of the throne.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Immediately
upon his accession, after providing for the safety of his kingdom
by throwing up entrenchments at the fordable points of the Forth,
he followed up the successes of his predecessor Indulf, ravaging
Cumberland to Stanemoor and Deerham, and carrying off a captive of high
rank amongst the neighbouring Saxons of Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Unfortunately
the old chronicle, which has hitherto so faithfully noted down the
events of this distant period, breaks off abruptly at the approach of
a more interesting epoch, and the history of Scotland must for many
years be sought for principally in the chronicles of other countries.
Considerable light is thrown upon the state of the extreme northern
districts during the reign of Kenneth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> by the accounts in the Norwegian
Sagas, as in the time of this king the powerful Jarls of Orkney were
first brought into collision with the neighbouring Mormaors on the
mainland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 875.</div>

<p>When Rognwald, Jarl of Mæri, heard of the death of his nephew Guttorm
Sigurdson,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> he immediately dispatched Hallad, one of his own sons,
to take possession of the Orkneys; but after a year’s experience of the
troublesome acquisition the newly appointed Jarl abruptly relinquished
his dominions, preferring the comparative peace of a <i>Holder’s</i>
life in Norway to the arduous dignity of a Jarl amongst the Vikings.
Vehemently incensed at his return, Rognwald bitterly reproached Hallad
and his brother with inheriting the servile blood of their mother,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
upon which Einar, hitherto conspicuous only for his excessive ugliness,
and the harshness of whose features was increased by the loss of
an eye, professed his readiness to undertake the government of the
Orkneys, remarking that he should relinquish a home which he had little
cause to love, and only requiring to be supplied with a ship and a
sufficient force to enable him to assert his claims successfully. He
added a promise, that if his offer were accepted his father should see
his face no more, a stipulation, as he drily observed, that was likely
to prove the most gratifying part of the arrangement. In his estimate
of his father’s feelings he was not mistaken, Rognwald frankly avowing
that were it for this sole purpose he should be provided with a ship,
though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> he feared little honour would result from the expedition. Such
were the circumstances under which the ancestor of the powerful Jarls
of Orkney first set sail from his native shores of Norway.</p>

<p>Arrived amongst the islands he soon cleared them of the Vikings, who
found in Einar a far more formidable opponent than the indolent and
peaceful Hallad. His promise to his father he kept to the letter,
and he saw his face no more; though when the increasing favour shewn
to Rognwald so provoked the jealousy of two of Harold’s sons that
they burnt the Jarl in his own house, Einar gloried in becoming his
avenger. Halfdan, one of the murderers, flying from the vengeance of
his incensed father, arrived so unexpectedly at the Orkneys that Einar
was taken by surprise and had barely time to escape to the mainland;
but his absence was of short duration, and surprising Halfdan in his
turn, he seized upon the wretched prince, inflicting on him the cruel
death of the Spread-eagle. Whatever punishment Harfager might have
intended for his son, he was exasperated on learning that Einar had
forestalled him, and immediately prepared a fleet for an expedition
against the Orkneys; but he suffered himself in the end to be diverted
from his intention, and was eventually satisfied with the exaction of a
heavy fine from the islands. Einar, however, turned even the intended
punishment to his own advantage, undertaking to pay the whole sum on
condition that the Odallers or Freeholders resigned their Odal rights
in his favour, or in other words submitted to be taxed and to hold
their lands of the Jarl; and from the date of this arrangement all the
lands in the earldom remained for many years the sole property of the
Jarls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>The rest of Einar’s life was passed in undisturbed possession of the
earldom he had so unexpectedly acquired; and upon his death it was
equally divided, according to the ancient custom, amongst his three
surviving sons. Arnkel and Erlend, the two eldest, followed the
fortunes of Eric Blodæxe, losing their lives in his service, when
the whole earldom was again reunited under the sole authority of the
surviving brother Thorfin the Skull-cleaver. In spite of his formidable
name, Thorfin was of a peaceful character, resembling his uncle Hallad
in his aversion to war, rather than his father Einar; and when the
sons of Eric arrived in the Orkneys with the shattered remnants of
their followers, he at once acknowledged their claim to his allegiance,
submitting without a struggle to their authority;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> though they soon
released him from further annoyance by sailing for Norway to try their
fortunes in their ancestral dominions, when Thorfin ruled his earldom
in peace, dying about the commencement of Kenneth’s reign.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> He
married Grelauga, a daughter of Duncan Mormaor of Caithness, by Groa,
the sister of Thorstein Olaveson, and upon his death left five sons
to inherit his island earldom, and possibly with some claims upon the
mainland inheritance of their maternal grandfather.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Three of the brothers in succession married Ragnhilda, the daughter
of Eric and Gunhilda. The mother had been celebrated as the most
treacherous, as well as the most beautiful woman of her time, and the
daughter appears to have inherited a full share of both the maternal
qualities. After contriving the murder of her first husband Arnfin, she
married his brother Havard, but soon repenting of her second choice,
she released herself with as little compunction as before, exerting her
influence over the Jarl’s favourite nephew with such success that the
luckless Havard was surprised and put to death by a kinsman of whom he
harboured not the remotest suspicion; and the scene of the foul murder,
the mysterious and once sacred “stones of Stennis” are still sometimes
known as Havard-Steigr. The first to exclaim against the treacherous
deed was the widowed consort of the Jarl, and Ragnhilda’s whole soul
appeared absorbed in a burning desire for vengeance, until the hope of
winning the favour of the beautiful mourner induced another relative
to undertake the sacred duty of revenge. Upon his return to claim the
promised reward—a fair wife and an earldom—he found them both in
the possession of the third brother Liotr, and he lost his life in a
vain attempt to wrest, at least the latter, from the more fortunate
son of Thorfin. Whilst Liotr was in possession of the earldom, Skuli,
one of his surviving brothers, presented himself at the court of the
Scottish king Kenneth, and obtained from him either a grant of the
possessions of his maternal ancestor the Mormaor of Caithness, or a
promise to support the pretensions he was encouraged to raise upon the
island dominions of his brother. Collecting an army in Caithness, Skuli
crossed the Pentland Firth to establish his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> claim upon the Orkneys,
but he failed in his attempt and was driven out of the islands; when
Liotr, emboldened by success, passed over to the mainland and again
defeated his brother in the Dales of Caithness, where Skuli lost his
life, continuing to fight bravely after the rout and dispersion of his
army. Liotr then subdued the whole of Caithness, a proceeding which
aroused the jealousy of his powerful neighbour Malbride MacRory the
“Earl,” or rather perhaps the “Oirrigh of Moray,” and both parties
preparing for a contest, Malbride advanced to Skida Moor to drive the
intruder from the country. The struggle was obstinate, victory in the
end declaring for the Orkneymen, though it was purchased with their
leader’s life, Liotr dying soon afterwards of a wound he received in
the battle. Lodver, the last surviving son of Thorfin, now succeeded
to the earldom, bequeathing it very shortly to his son Sigurd. He was
the only member of his family who died a peaceful death, owing perhaps
to his marriage with Auda, a daughter of an Irish king Kerval, an
alliance through which he was fortunate enough to escape the dangerous
fascinations of Ragnhilda.</p>

<p>Jarl Sigurd Lodverson retained forcible possession of Caithness,
intrusting it to the charge of his brother-in-law Havard, until
intelligence reached him ere long that two Scottish nobles, whom
the Saga describes as “Earls,” had slain Havard in Threswick and
were ravaging his territories on the mainland. The Jarl waited only
to collect his followers from the Orkneys, and crossing the Firth
was joined by the men of his other earldom, who informed him that
the Scottish leaders, to whom the Saga gives the names of Hundi and
Malsnechtan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> were at that moment in the neighbourhood of Duncansby
Head. Unlike Sigurd, who was now advancing with his whole force united,
the Scots allowed themselves to be drawn into action before the arrival
of an expected reinforcement; and although victory inclined to their
side in the early part of the battle, Malsnechtan was slain at the
close, and Hundi driven from the field; though any advantage that might
have arisen from Sigurd’s success was neutralized by the approach of
“Earl” Malcolm, who appears to have landed during the contest with a
considerable force at Dungall’s Bay. The Jarl’s men, already exhausted
by a protracted and hardly contested struggle, were in no condition
for a second engagement with the fresh army advancing under Malcolm,
so collecting the trophies of his barren victory, Sigurd retreated to
his island fastnesses, and the mainland conquests of the Orkney Jarls
reverted for the time to other possessors.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>It must have been soon after this battle that Olave Tryggveson,
returning from England to Norway, touched at the Orkneys, and
seizing upon Sigurd, who was totally unprepared for an attack, with
all the zeal of a recent convert, offered him the alternative of
immediate execution or of at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> embracing the Christian faith, and
acknowledging himself a tributary of Norway. Any lingering love of
Odinism vanished before the necessity of the case, Christianity became
the religion of the islands, and Olave carried off Hundi Sigurdson as
a hostage for the fidelity of his father. His allegiance to Norway sat
lightly on the Jarl, and ceased with the life of his son a few years
afterwards; but as the conversion of the Orkneymen dates from this
summary proceeding, and no allusion is ever made to a relapse, it may
perhaps be concluded that his Christianity was more enduring.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Whilst these events were occurring in the North, and the attention
of the Moray chieftains was fully occupied by the encroachments of
their powerful neighbours, Kenneth, who appears to have been an able
and energetic prince, seems to have been actively engaged in another
quarter of his dominions; and although no account has been handed down
of the nature of the transaction which eventually cost the king his
life, there is much reason to connect it with an attempt on his part to
reduce under his more immediate power a portion of the kingdom which
had hitherto continued in a condition of comparative independence.</p>

<p>Extending along the eastern coast of Scotland was a district of which
the whole or part was known as Angus, though it would be difficult to
define its ancient limits with accuracy. In later days the name of
Angus has been looked upon as equivalent to Forfarshire, but the old
Pictish kingdom may once have reached to the Isla and the Tay, on its
southern frontiers, whilst towards the north it bordered on the marches
of Mar, or by whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> name the district may have been known, which
was once the principality of Cyric.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Originally an independent
province, it probably became subordinate at some remote period to the
kingdom of which the foundations were laid by the elder Angus and
Constantine, in other words, the lord of the district paid <i>can</i>
or <i>cios</i> to the king of Scots in peace, or acknowledged his
authority in some similar manner, and led his followers to support the
royal cause in war; but beyond such vague tokens of dependence he ruled
with undiminished authority over all who acknowledged his claim to be
their <i>Cen-cinneth</i>, or the head of their race by “right of blood.”</p>

<p>During the earlier reigns of the kings of the line of Kintyre,
the “Mormaors” of Angus were evidently personages of considerable
importance, as their deaths are occasionally entered in the oldest
existing chronicle, the latest notice of a member of the family
occurring during the reign of Colin. In the time of Kenneth the direct
male line appears to have ended in Cunechat or Connor, who transmitted
his rights to a daughter of the name of Finella, and she hoped in
her turn to bequeath them to her son. In this expectation she was
disappointed, for upon some long forgotten pretext the heir of Angus
was condemned and executed at Dunsinnan;<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and as the greater part
of this province was included in the deaneries of Gowrie, Angus, and
the Merns, which, after the changes introduced into the constitution
of the Scottish church by David the First, appear under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> the episcopal
jurisdiction of St. Andrews, it is highly probable that the “Bishop of
the Scots” first acquired his spiritual authority in this direction
when “the King of Scots” cut off the last heir of the ancient line of
princes and annexed his province to the crown, exercising the rights of
a conqueror by “giving Brechin to the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The bereaved mother never forgave the outrage, and the scene of
Kenneth’s death, Fettercairn in Kincardineshire, where he is said
to have perished through the treachery of his immediate attendants,
favours the tradition connecting the catastrophe with the vengeance of
Finella. If any credit can be attached to the accounts of authorities
who wrote four centuries after the occurrence, policy induced her
to wear the appearance of forgetfulness until she had succeeded in
persuading the king to entrust himself within the walls of her “castle
of Fettercairn,” where he lost his life by a curious and complicated
machine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> most ingeniously contrived for the fatal deed! <span class="sni">A.
D. 995.</span> Be this as it may, Kenneth was assassinated after a reign of
twenty-four years, and if Finella, as is not improbable, was the author
of his death, it is likely that her purpose was accomplished without
the aid of any very elaborate mechanical contrivance, and scarcely
within the walls of a feudal castle.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Fordun has attributed to this king the idea of limiting the succession
to his immediate family, gravely adding, that the example of the German
empire exercised much influence in deciding Kenneth to adopt this
line of policy.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The fate of Olave MacIndulf, at the commencement
of this reign, lends some degree of probability to the suggestion of
the historian, though the king was hardly successful in his supposed
policy, as the usual order of succession was preserved, and two princes
intervened before the accession of his son Malcolm. More than one
fabrication has been palmed upon this reign, and the memory of the king
has been needlessly blackened by the assumed murder of Malcolm MacDuff,
a personage of more than questionable reality, for whose existence
Fordun is the earliest authority; though it is possible that some
confusion may have arisen between the imaginary king of the Cumbrians
and the real Olave, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> death is noticed by Tighernach the Irish
annalist, a few years after the accession of Kenneth to the throne.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Hector Boece is the first writer who places the victory of Loncarty in
this reign, for Fordun makes no allusion to it, though his continuator
Walter Bowyer mentions “the wonderful battle of Loncarty,” fought at
a time when a Norwegian army, after ravaging the country in every
direction, had shut up a Pictish king within the ancient city of Perth.
The provisions of the besieged were upon the point of failing, when
the wily Pict, by a judicious present of his two last casks of wine,
reduced his enemies to a state that ensured him an easy victory. A
successful sortie was directed against the invaders’ camp, their ships
were burnt and sunk at the mouth of the Tay, obstructing the river, and
originating the sandbanks of Drumlay, and every subsequent invasion
of the northern foe, down to the expedition of Haco, in the reign of
Alexander the Third, was supposed to have been undertaken in revenge
for this fatal disaster.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Such is the earliest account of the famous battle of Loncarty.
There can be little doubt about its real occurrence, and it was
fought probably upon the occasion of one of the earlier inroads
of the Northmen at the most formidable epoch of their power. The
recollection of a great victory gained upon this spot would long be
preserved in the traditions of the surrounding neighbourhood, but for
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> circumstantial narrative embellishing the pages of Boece, that

<p>The assassination of Kenneth at Fettercairn raised Colin’s son
Constantine to the throne of Scotland. The last inheritor of the blood
of the second Constantine, his reign, like his father’s, was short and
troubled, as he lost his life two years after his accession, in a vain
attempt to resist the pretensions of Kenneth MacDuff.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> <span class="sni">
A. D. 997.</span> Upon the extinction of the Scottish branch of the “Clan
Aodh MacKenneth,” the radical defect of the old system of succession
was at once developed in the immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> division of the “Clan
Constantine MacKenneth,”—hitherto united by a common enmity,—into
two hostile “factions,” headed respectively by the grandsons of the
first Malcolm. Nothing whatever is recorded of the reign of Kenneth the
Third, sometimes known as Grim or Græme, a name supposed to signify
the profession of great strength, or a certain sternness of character.
The chronicles are silent beyond the barren facts of his accession
and death, <span class="sni">A. D. 1005.</span> placing the latter at Monaghvaird
in Strathearn, where his defeat eight years after his victory over
Constantine raised his cousin Malcolm, the son of Kenneth the Second,
to the vacant throne of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>


<h3><i>Malcolm the Second.</i> 1005–1034.</h3>

<p>In imitation apparently of the example of his father, Malcolm
signalized his accession by one of those inroads upon Northumbria
which point significantly to the gradual extension of the Scottish
kingdom on her southern frontier. Borne down by the weight of years,
Ealdorman Waltheof, shutting himself up within the walls of Bamborough,
placidly let the storm sweep by; but his son Uchtred, who had married
the daughter of the bishop, was neither of an age nor of a temperament
to look quietly on while the broad lands he had received in dowry with
his bride were wasted by the northern invaders. Summoning the men of
Northumberland and Yorkshire to join his standard, he soon collected
a numerous force, <span class="sni">A. D. 1006.</span> and suddenly attacking
Malcolm before the gates of Durham drove him from the territory of St.
Cuthbert.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>The next step of the victorious Uchtred affords a singular example of
the manners of the age. Severing from the bodies of the fallen Scots
a sufficient number of the best-looking heads, he committed them to
the charge of four women, each of whom was to receive a cow in payment
for plaiting the hair and arraying to the best advantage these grim
relics of the foe, which were then placed on stakes at equal intervals
around the walls of Durham, to answer the double purpose of striking
terror into any future band of marauding Scots, and of recalling to the
grateful townsmen the services of their brave deliverer. Having cleared
the country of the enemy and seen to the arrangement of his revolting
trophies, Uchtred bore to Ethelred the welcome news of his victory, and
was rewarded for his gallantry with the hand of the king’s daughter—he
seems to have had neither scruple nor difficulty in releasing himself
from his former wife—as well as with a grant of the <i>eorldom</i>
of the Yorkshire Danes, in addition to his father’s <i>ealdordom</i>
beyond the Tyne.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>About the same time as Malcolm’s disaster before Durham, Finlay
MacRory, who had succeeded his brother Malbride in the chieftainship of
Moray,—in the words of the Norwegian Saga—“marked out a battle-field
for Jarl Sigurd on Skida Moor.” To decline the proffered contest would
have been disgraceful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> but the Jarl had serious doubts about the
result, for he was afraid that the Scots would outnumber him; and as
his followers were infected with a similar misgiving, they murmured at
the risk until Sigurd promised to restore the Odal privileges which
their ancestors had resigned in the days of Einar Rognwaldson. On
this agreement they followed him with alacrity, and to increase their
confidence Sigurd bore with him one of those mystic banners, so famous
amongst the ancient Northmen, wrought in the form of a flying raven
whose wings expanded in the wind. It was the work of the Jarl’s mother,
the daughter of the Irish Kerval, and upon it she had expended all the
magic lore for which she was renowned, promising victory to all who
followed, but death to him who bore it. On this occasion the charm was
successful, three warriors who carried the fated standard falling one
after the other in the battle; but Jarl Sigurd won the day, and the
Bonders of Orkney were rewarded for their valour by the restitution of
their Odal privileges.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The success of Sigurd against the Moray Mormaor, far from embroiling
him with Malcolm, appears to have been rather gratifying to the
Scottish king, who immediately gave him the hand of his younger
daughter in marriage; and from this union sprung Thorfin Sigurdson, who
upon the death of his father in the memorable battle of Clontarf, was
immediately confirmed by Malcolm in the mainland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> earldom of Sutherland
and Caithness, whilst the Orkneys and other island possessions fell to
the share of the elder sons of Sigurd.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Soon after Malcolm had thus established his grandson in the northern
extremity of his kingdom, an opportunity again occurred for extending
his dominions on the Northumbrian frontier, which ever since the days
of Indulf had been the object of the aggressions of the Scottish kings.
The sceptre of a great nation was fast escaping from the feeble grasp
of Ethelred, and Uchtred, the opponent of Malcolm’s earlier years,
after twice submitting to the Danish invaders, had been put to death
with the connivance of Canute from mingled motives of policy and
revenge.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The guardianship of the northern frontiers then fell
into the hands of Eadulf Cudel, the imitator of the supineness of his
father Waltheof, rather than of the energy of his brother Uchtred.
He could expect but little assistance from the Yorkshire Danes, who
upon the death of Uchtred had been placed under the authority of their
countryman Eric, and as the distracted state of Northumbria was not
lost upon Malcolm, twelve years after his former disaster, collecting
his followers for a second invasion, he prepared to exact a fearful
retribution for the trophies mouldering around the walls of Durham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1018.</div>

<p>During thirty days and nights, a comet, a baleful and ill-omened
prodigy in the eyes of the Northumbrians of the eleventh century,
blazed forth, a presage of impending woe; and when the men of St.
Cuthbert’s joined their countrymen at Carham, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> banks of the
Tweed, it was only to participate in the disasters of a defeat, and
to perish in multitudes in a disorderly flight. The aged bishop sunk
under the shock, dying within a few days of the battle, and such was
the confusion throughout the diocese of St. Cuthbert’s that for three
years no successor was elected. Despairing of resistance against the
power of the conqueror, Eadulf Cudel purchased an inglorious peace
at the price of relinquishing Lothian, the whole of ancient Bernicia
beyond the Tweed was ceded to the Scottish king, and Malcolm returned
in triumph to the north, having effectually obliterated the remembrance
of his failure by a more brilliant and substantial success than any of
his predecessors had hitherto achieved.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1031.</div>

<p>Towards the close of his life, and about thirteen years after his
successful invasion of Northumbria, Malcolm was brought into contact
with the most formidable antagonist that ever crossed his path, for
upon his return from Rome, Canute, now king of England, Denmark, and
Norway, marched with an army to the north, and both kings met upon the
frontiers of their respective dominions. As no allusion is made to the
cause which led to the expedition of Canute, it would be impossible to
determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> whether it had any reference to Malcolm’s acquisition of
Lothian. A brief notice in the Saxon chronicle—all that is known of
the transaction—barely records that Malcolm met Canute, “bowed to his
power, and became his man, retaining his allegiance for a very short
time.” Canute with his army returned to the south, and the results of
the meeting faded away with the retreating footsteps of the mighty
Dane.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1033</div>

<p>Amongst the latest notices of this reign contained in the Irish annals,
an action is recorded of Malcolm, towards the close of his career,
which clearly demonstrates his determined purpose to transmit the regal
dignity to his own immediate descendants. According to the rule of
alternate succession hitherto observed amongst the Scots—a rule which
the later princes had invariably attempted to violate—the next king
after Malcolm’s death ought to have been chosen from the family of his
predecessor Kenneth. Boedhe, the late king’s son, was no longer living,
but he had left a son whose name is no longer preserved, the last male
representative of his race, and perhaps the Tanist, or heir apparent of
the king. The death of this prince is attributed to Malcolm, whose aim
it is evident in this deed of violence was to remove from the path of
his grandson Duncan the sole rival claimant of the throne.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In this
he was completely successful, no opposition awaiting his grandson when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
he was called soon afterwards to reign; nor had Duncan long to wait for
the crown, for in the following year <span class="sni">A. D. 1034.</span> Malcolm
was assassinated at Glammis, in the same province of Angus which forty
years before had proved so fatal to his father.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Of the direct male line of Kenneth MacAlpin, Malcolm the Second was
the last and greatest king, his renown extending to the neighbouring
countries, and procuring for him the title amongst the Irish annalists
of the “Lord and Father of the West.” He enlarged and consolidated his
ancestral dominions, advancing the frontier from the Pentland Hills to
the Tweed, and effecting an object that his predecessors had vainly
attempted—the transmission of the kingdom to his own immediate family.
The means employed for this purpose, it is to be feared, were neither
scrupulous nor just; but the annals of every country at this period
prove but too clearly that it was an age in which neither the ties of
relationship, nor indeed any other ties, were proof against the lust of
ambition.</p>

<p>Scotland had now reached her permanent and lasting frontier towards the
south, the dependent principality of Strath Clyde having apparently,
during the course of this reign, been finally incorporated with the
greater kingdom. When Donald, son of the Eogan who shared in the bloody
fight of Brunanburgh, died on a pilgrimage in 975, he seems to have
been succeeded by his son Malcolm, whose death is noticed by the Irish
Tighernach under the date of 997.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The last king of Strath Clyde
who has found a place in history is Eogan “the bald,” who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> fought by
the side of the Scottish king at Carham,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> probably a son of the
British Malcolm whose family name he bears; and in the person of this
Eogan the line of Aodh’s son Donald appears to have become extinct. The
earliest authorities of the twelfth century give the title of “king
of the Cumbrians,” meaning undoubtedly the northern Cumbria or Strath
Clyde, to Malcolm’s grandson Duncan, and it is probable that upon the
failure of the line of Scoto-British princes, the king of Scotland
placed his grandson over the province, which from that time, losing the
last semblance of independence, ceased to be ruled by a separate line
of princes.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>To Malcolm the Second has sometimes been attributed the foundation
of an Episcopal See at Mortlach, which was afterwards transferred to
Aberdeen;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and though as far as relates to the establishment of a
regular diocese this account must be rejected, Malcolm, in imitation of
his father’s policy in the case of Brechin, may have “given Mortlach to
the Lord;” or, in other words, he may have founded and endowed a Culdee
monastery on this spot. As the erection of a religious establishment
in those days necessarily implies the possession of the surrounding
district, if the tradition is correct which connects Mortlach with the
reign of Malcolm the Second, the plains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> Lothian were not his only
conquest; and, in the same manner as Kenneth acquired Angus, he must
have annexed to the dominions of the Scottish crown some portion of
the ancient kingdom which once aspired to be the leading principality
amongst the Pictish provinces of the north.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Certain other changes are attributed to this king, which, however they
may have become warped and disguised by the <i>feudal</i> ideas of the
authorities in whose pages they are found, when they are considered in
connection with the actual historical events of the period, undoubtedly
seem to point to Malcolm’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> reign as the era of a certain advance
towards the consolidation of the royal authority, such as is distinctly
traceable at different epochs in many other countries. A twofold bond
of union existed from a very early period amongst the communities into
which the Celtic and Germanic people were divided, and the noble,
prince, or king, was followed either from the “tie of blood,” as the
actual head of the race, or from “the tie of service,” as the lord
and master who repaid all who rendered such service according to the
prevalent customs of the age; and as the former tie was at the root of
the <i>allodial</i>, so out of the latter gradually arose the theory of
the <i>feudal</i> system. Originally the tie of blood united freeman
with freeman, whilst the tie of service connected the free with the
unfree, but as inequality of rank grew up from various causes, the
lesser freeman was glad to “take service” with the greater in return
for his protection and support, thus forming the class known as
<i>Gasinds</i> (or <i>Gesiths</i>) amongst the Germans, and amongst the
Gael apparently in early times as <i>Amasach</i>—a word evidently akin
to the old Celtic <i>Ambact</i>—who were either quartered temporarily
upon the unfree tenantry of their patron as military retainers, or at a
later period frequently exercised a delegated authority over the crown
lands as <i>Grafs</i>, <i>Gerefas</i>, or <i>Maors</i>. As the royal
power was increased by acquisitions at the expense of a neighbouring
state, or as the head of one community acquired a permanent superiority
over the rest, the importance and numbers of the royal <i>Gasinds</i>
and <i>Amasach</i> increased proportionally, and very frequently,
instead of the original usage, according to which the greater part of
the newly acquired territory would have been portioned out more or less
permanently amongst the conquerors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> as <i>Allod</i>, <i>Odal</i>, or
<i>Duchas</i>, land—untaxed freehold held by right of blood—as it
was more advantageous to the sovereign to reserve as much as possible
for the use of the crown, the older proprietary were retained as a
tributary class, remaining undisturbed under the authority of the
Gasinds and Amasach, who, acting as royal deputies, collected the
king’s rents and led his dependants to battle, reserving for their
“service” a certain portion of the royal dues, almost invariably a
third. Such was the original tenure of the <i>Graphiones</i> of the
early Frank kings, of the Ealdormen and Eorls, amongst the Anglo-Saxons
and Anglo-Danes, and of the royal Jarls established by Harald Harfagar
and other kings throughout the north; in short, it was, in early times,
the universal tenure of the royal <i>official</i>, before “knight
service” and the <i>feud</i> gradually superseded nearly every other
tenure amongst the nobility.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, the royal official placed over the crown or fiscal lands
appears to have been originally known as the <i>Maor</i> (the type
of the royal <i>Maer</i> amongst the Cymri), and latterly under the
Teutonic appellation of Thane, either a corrupted form of the Gaelic
Ti’ern, or a title like <i>Earl</i>, arising from the prevalence of
Anglo-Saxon law and technical phraseology after the introduction of
feudalism; for the feudalism introduced by David and his successors,
though Anglo-Norman, was very much based upon the Anglo-Saxon, or
what was much the same, the Lothian law and customs. The epithet of
Thanage was applied as well to the office as to the district over
which it was exercised, of which the old Scottish name may have been
<i>Triocha-ced</i> or <i>Cantred</i>, a name long equivalent amongst
the Irish to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> <i>barony</i>.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The offices of <i>Maer</i> and
<i>Cynghellwr</i> (or judge), amongst the Welsh, could never be
conferred upon the head of a clan (or <i>Pencenedyl</i>), the same
maxim of policy very probably being equally in force in Scotland, for
it is in strict accordance with the immemorial Celtic principle “divide
et impera;” though it may be equally referable to the invariable
hostility of early royalty to <i>Allodial</i> or <i>Duchas</i> tenure
from its independence of the sovereign authority. The original
Thanage then would appear to have been a district held of the Crown,
differing but little except in tenure, from a tract of land held by
<i>Duchas</i> right; the holder, Maor or Thane, being accountable for
the collection of the royal dues, and for the appearance of the royal
tenantry at the yearly “hosting,” and answering to the hereditary
<i>Toshach</i> or captain of a clan—for the king stood in the place
of the <i>Cen-cinneth</i>, or chief—whilst the official who acted as
judge, and was subsequently known as the <i>Deempster</i> (the Welsh
<i>Cynghellwr</i>) represented the hereditary <i>Brehon</i> of the
tribe, the place of the lesser <i>Duchasach</i> or <i>Brugaidhs</i>
being generally supplied in course of time by the kinsmen of the
Thane, planted on the Thanage to hold under the head of their race as
<i>Ogtierns</i>, Mesne lords, or Vavassours.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> The theory of “a
<i>Toshach</i> over every <i>Triocha-ced</i>, and a <i>Brugaidh</i>
over every <i>Baile</i>,” was equally familiar to the Irish Gael, and
as the tie uniting the officials with the population of the whole
Thanage was “service,” not “blood,” the Thane was often known amongst
his followers as their <i>Toshach</i> or captain, rather than their
<i>Cen-cinneth</i> or chief by right of blood.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>When lands were strictly retained in the crown, the Royal Thane or Maor
was answerable directly to the king, but there was a still greater
official amongst the Scots, untraceable apparently in his peculiar
Scottish characteristics amongst the kindred Welsh and Irish, known
under the title of the <i>Mormaor</i> or Lord High Steward. One example
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> peculiar tenure of the Mormaor was still existing in the
thirteenth century in the Earl of Fife; for when the second Alexander
and his “Parliament” levied fines upon all who had failed in their
attendance on the occasion of his expedition against “Donald MacNiel of
the Isles,” the earls and their “serjeants” were strictly prohibited
from entering the lands of any “tenant <i>in capite</i>”—holding
directly of the king—to exact the penalty imposed, excepting only the
Earl of Fife, who exercised this privilege throughout his district, not
as the Earl, but as the Royal <i>Maor</i> of the county of Fife, “to
claim his rights,” or, in other words, to secure his allotted portion
of the mulct.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The ancient Scottish Mormaor, then, was evidently
a Maor placed over a province instead of a thanage—an earldom or
country instead of a barony—a type of Harfager’s royal Jarl, who often
exercised as a royal deputy that authority which he had originally
claimed as the independent lord of the district over which he presided.
This change was rendered very popular amongst the aristocracy of the
north, from the great increase of wealth they derived through retaining
a third of the tribute exacted in the king’s name from the classes
hitherto untaxed; and similar considerations may have exercised an
influence in facilitating the conversion of the semi-independent
Gaelic <i>Oirrigh</i> into a dependent, but probably far wealthier,
<i>Mormaor</i>.</p>

<p>The existence of the royal Maor and Mormaor—officials in direct
dependence on the king, and resembling the royal Jarls and Lendermen
amongst the Northmen, or the king’s Ealdorman and Gerefa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> amongst the
Anglo-Saxons—implies a greater consolidation and compactness in the
Scottish monarchy than was ever attained amongst the kindred Celts of
Ireland or Wales; and it is to the policy pursued during the reigns
of Malcolm and his father Kenneth that this result is probably to be
attributed. The Maor, indeed, was an official familiar to the Gaelic
people long before the era of Kenneth and Malcolm, and he probably
played an important part in the conquered provinces annexed by the
elder Angus and his successors; but the Mormaor—the head of a province
ruling as a royal deputy instead of an independent prince—points to
a revolution in the tenure of land resembling the changes introduced
by Harfager, when he cancelled “<i>Odal</i> right” wherever he could
extend his authority, and levied <i>land-tax</i> by means of his Jarls
and Lendermen; and it was a revolution of this description that may
possibly have been carried out in the course of Malcolm’s reign and
that of his father. Scotland, according to Fordun, was portioned out
in ancient times into Thanages, or Fee-farms paying rent, held of
course of the crown—for any other theory was incompatible with the
ideas of the feudal era—until Malcolm, remitting the rents, gave away
the whole kingdom, only reserving to himself the Moot Hill of Scone,
when in return for the royal prodigality his people confirmed their
sovereign’s right to wardship, relief, and other feudal privileges.
Lurking under this singular statement there are probably some grains
of truth, thoroughly misunderstood by the chronicler; and as in the
partition of Scotland into Thanages a tradition may be recognized of
its ancient division into <i>Triocha-ceds</i> and <i>Bailes</i>, or
Baronies and Townlands—institutions of a character inseparable from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the very existence of a <i>settled</i> community—so the reduction of
the kingdom of Scotland as it then existed to a more direct dependence
upon the royal authority, entailing land-tax, <i>merchet</i>, and other
Celtic mulcts, in quarters hitherto exempt from such exactions, seems
to be shadowed out under the <i>feudal</i> grant of the whole kingdom
and the <i>feudal</i> return made by the gratitude of the Scottish
people. Like Wales and Ireland, the whole kingdom was probably divided
in theory into <i>Triocha-ceds</i>, <i>Cantreds</i>, or Thanages,
the tribe lands held by chieftains as untaxed <i>Duchas</i>, the
crown-lands by Maors or Thanes answerable for the rents and dues;
and if Malcolm, by cancelling “<i>Duchas</i> right” as far as it lay
in his power, assimilated the tenure of the whole kingdom to that
of the royal Maor, or, in other words, taxed the hitherto untaxed
<i>Duchasach</i>, he only brought about the same change which Harfager
had already effected in Norway, and which the ministers of the Frank
kings were continually aiming at five or six centuries before his
era. As the Thanage was evidently regarded in feudal times as the
ancient Scottish tenure throughout the whole kingdom, some such change
must have been introduced upon the older state of society before the
establishment of the feudal system, and both tradition and history seem
to point to the second Malcolm as the sovereign who first carried out
successfully a revolution so important for the aggrandizement of the
royal authority.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>An apocryphal collection of laws, relating principally to the
regulation of the court, has been also ascribed to the same king; and
though the laws are unquestionably fabrications, it is not impossible
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> they were framed in a feudal era to represent the regulations
which Malcolm was traditionally supposed to have enacted. The
promulgation of a code of laws necessarily involves the acquiescence of
all who submit to be bound by them in the supremacy of the lawgiver;
and when a king is said to have established or re-enacted such a code,
it may be regarded as an indirect proof of a certain stability in the
authority thus centred in the royal person. When “the Gael” assembled
at Forteviot to ratify with their king, Donald, the laws of his
ancestor Aodh the Fair, and when they gathered round the Moot Hill of
Scone, to confirm perhaps with Constantine the privileges conferred by
Cyric on the See of St. Andrews, the superiority of the dynasty, whose
representative presided in these assemblies, was evidently acknowledged
by all who attended at their summons. The establishment of a court, the
enhancement of the dignity of personal attendance on the sovereign,
and the regulation of the duties and privileges attached to such
service, point again to a further advance of the royal power, and to a
certain increase in the kingly dignity attendant upon a fixed court and
residence; marking as it were an approach to the gradual conversion of
a <i>migratory</i> king quartering himself during his yearly progresses
upon the provincial aristocracy, and upon the stewards of the royal
manors, into a <i>stationary</i> monarch, summoning his dependent
nobility to attend upon their sovereign’s person in his own court and
palace. The laws of Howel Dha, relating entirely to the duties and
privileges of “the Court of Aberfraw,” and the similar arrangements of
the Norwegian Olaf, probably have reference to the commencement or the
progress of a revolution of this description; and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> the apocryphal
regulations of the Scottish court may be regarded as the <i>feudal</i>
embodiment of a true tradition, Malcolm may be looked upon as the
originator of that change through which the Scottish king, ceasing
gradually to migrate from one province to another, enhanced the dignity
of personal attendance upon the sovereign, and assembled his nobility
in his own “palace” of Scone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="subhed smcap">The Line of Atholl.</span></h2></div>

<h3><i>Duncan the First</i>—1034–1040.</h3>


<p>Upon the death of Malcolm the Second the direct male line of Kenneth
MacAlpin became extinct; but the rights of the royal race, originally
inherited through the female line, were transmitted in the same manner
through heiresses to the two great families of Atholl and Moray, whose
disputes for the crown were destined to become as fruitful a source of
strife and bloodshed as the sanguinary struggle between their immediate
ancestors, or the earlier feuds between the lines of Constantine and
Aodh.</p>

<p>Boedhe, the death of whose son has been already noticed, left a
daughter, Gruoch, who, by her marriage with Gilcomgain, the son of
Malbride MacRory, carried the claims of the line of Duff, after the
death of her brother, into the family of the Moray Mormaors. Finlay
MacRory, the antagonist of Sigurd Lodverson, lost his life in a feud
with his nephews Malcolm and Gilcomgain, to the former of whom the
earldom reverted according to the Gaelic rule of succession, until his
death in 1029, when it fell into the possession of his younger brother
Gilcomgain. Three years later the Mormaor was surprised and burnt in
his <i>Rath</i> or fortress, with fifty of his immediate followers,
leaving an infant son, Lulach, who, after the death of Boedhe’s son in
the following year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> became the sole remaining representative of the
line of Kenneth Macduff. Gruoch, the widow of Gilcomgain, was married
eventually to Macbeth MacFinlay,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> who had succeeded her late
husband and his own cousin in the Mormaorship of Moray, when, as the
husband of Gruoch and the guardian of the infant Lulach, Macbeth became
the representative during the minority of the latter of his claims upon
the crown of Scotland.</p>

<p>Bethoc, or Beatrice, the eldest of the late king’s daughters, carried
her claims to the race of Atholl by her marriage with Crinan, Abbot of
Dunkeld, who was also the head of the Atholl family.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Their son
was Duncan, the heir and successor of his grandfather, who, before his
accession to the throne of Scotland, had been placed by Malcolm over
the dependent province of Strath Clyde.</p>

<p>Another of Malcolm’s daughters, a younger sister of Beatrice, married
Sigurd Lodverson soon after his victory over the Mormaor Finlay, the
father of Macbeth, when it was evidently the object of the late king
to secure the alliance of the Orkney Jarl as a formidable rival to the
hostile family of Moray. <span class="sni">A. D. 1014.</span> After the fall of
Sigurd in the battle of Clontarf, his son Thorfin, as has been already
mentioned, when a mere child, was placed by his grandfather over the
earldom of Sutherland and Caithness, whilst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> Orkneys were inherited
by his three half-brothers, Einar, Somarled, and Brusi. Upon the death
of Somarled, a few years later, Thorfin claimed a share of the islands,
when Einar prepared to resist his pretensions by force, but through
the intervention of the other brother, Brusi, Thorfin succeeded in
attaining his object, and in this manner he first acquired a footing in
the Orkneys.</p>

<p>Einar perished shortly afterwards in a feud, when a fresh difficulty
arose upon his death about the division of his portion of the islands.
Brusi, fearful lest king Malcolm, who was then alive, should support
the claims of his grandson, determined upon enlisting the king of
Norway in his own behalf, and for this purpose he sailed for the latter
country, whither he was soon followed by Thorfin, who thought with much
justice (to use the words of the Saga), “that though he stood well with
Olaf, and many would support him in his absence, many more would do so
if he were present.” Before the arrival of his younger brother, Brusi
had already resigned his Odal rights into the hands of Olaf, agreeing
to be bound by the royal decision, and to hold all his lands as a
<i>Lenderman</i> or royal Jarl at the will and pleasure of the king.
When a similar resignation was demanded from Thorfin, he hesitated at
first to acquiesce in any such arrangement; but after consulting with
his friends he agreed with such alacrity to every proposition of Olaf,
that the suspicions of the king were aroused, and deciding that Einar’s
portion had reverted to the Norwegian crown, he restored it to Brusi,
relying more upon the fidelity of the elder brother than upon the
youthful but ambitious Thorfin.</p>

<p>The pacific Brusi soon found reason to complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> of his brother,
after their return to the Orkneys, for neglecting to contribute his
allotted portion towards the defence of the islands; as Thorfin,
residing continually on the mainland, was satisfied with limiting his
connection with his insular fiefs to the punctual exaction of his dues.
The younger Jarl offered to rectify his neglect, by taking the whole
trouble out of the hands of his elder brother, on condition that the
latter in return should surrender the disputed share; and as peace, not
power, was the object of the indolent Brusi, he willingly purchased
it at the price of insignificance, and at his death, which occurred
about the year 1030, Thorfin, <span class="sni">A. D. 1030.</span> without further
scruple, annexed the whole of the Orkneys to his dominions.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of Scotland when Duncan the First succeeded to
the throne of his grandfather. In the extreme north, dominions more
extensive than any Jarl of the Orkneys had hitherto acquired, were
united under the rule of Thorfin Sigurdson, whose character and
appearance have been thus described—“He was stout and strong, but
very ugly, severe and cruel, but a very clever man.” The extensive
districts then dependant upon the Moray Mormaors were in the possession
of the celebrated Macbeth, and though the power of those northern
magnates must undoubtedly have been weakened by the aggressions of the
Norwegian Jarls, it tells not a little for the energy and vigour of
the late king, that his grandson was able to ascend the throne without
encountering any opposition from the formidable representative of the
claims of the rival family.</p>

<p>The early portion of Duncan’s reign is void of incident, but, before
long, the mainland possessions of Thorfin appear to have become an
object of dispute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> the king demanding the usual tribute due from a
dependancy of Scotland, whilst the Jarl denied the justice of his
claim, maintaining that he held his earldom by Odal right, as an
absolute and unconditional gift from their joint grandfather Malcolm.
At length Duncan, to punish his kinsman’s contumacy and assert the
rights of the crown, determined upon appointing another member of
his family, Moddan or Madach, to replace Thorfin in the earldom, and
dispatching Madach with an army to the north, he empowered him to take
possession of the royal grant.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1040.</span> Much about
the same time, the Scottish king, desirous of extending the conquests
of his grandfather towards the south, laid siege to Durham, but the
town was destined to become as fatal to the hopes of Duncan as it had
once been disastrous to those of Malcolm, a sudden and unexpected sally
spread confusion amongst the besieging army, and again the heads of
the Scottish slain were ranged in triumph around the hostile walls of
Durham.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Madach had been equally unsuccessful in his attempt upon the earldom
of Thorfin. Warned of the approach of his rival, the Jarl summoned
Thorkell Fostri to join him with the Orkneymen in Caithness, and
Madach, perceiving that an engagement with their united forces would
only be attended with a disastrous result, retreated southwards for
reinforcements, whilst Thorfin availed himself of the opportunity
to overrun the neighbouring district of Ross. Intelligence of his
proceedings reached the king at Berwick, deciding him to march at once
towards the north, in order to support in person his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> grant of the
earldom to Madach. It appears to have been Duncan’s object to cut off
Thorfin from the Orkneys, thus preventing his junction with Thorkell
Fostri and his Norwegians, whom the Jarl, on the retreat of his rival,
had permitted to return to the islands; and to carry out his purpose,
he despatched Madach towards Caithness with the land army, whilst with
eleven vessels he sailed round Duncansby Head to interpose his ships
between the Jarl and his island home; hoping thus either to force him
to fight at a disadvantage with the superior numbers of Madach, or to
drive him southwards upon those Highland districts which were less well
affected to his cause.</p>

<p>The sight of Duncan’s sails in the Pentland Firth conveyed to Thorfin
the earliest intelligence of his enemy’s approach, and, baffled in
an attempt to put to sea, and thus escape to Sandwick, he was forced
to lie off Dyrness for the night and to await the king’s attack on
the following morning.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The ships of Thorfin were laden with the
plunder of the northern provinces of Scotland, and his men fought so
desperately in defence of their booty, that the king was beaten off
and obliged to make for the coast of Moray, whither he was speedily
followed by the united forces of Thorfin and Thorkell Fostri; the Jarl
watching the movements of Duncan and collecting reinforcements from
Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross, whilst he dispatched Thorkell to
surprise Madach, who had now reached Thurso, where he was resting in
unguarded security. The fidelity of the men of Caithness ably seconded
the projects of their Jarl, so effectually concealing the approach
of Thorkell, that the first notice of danger was conveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> to the
unfortunate Madach by the flames of his burning house, and he perished
in a vain attempt to burst through the ranks of his enemies, and escape
from the blazing ruins.</p>

<p>The Scottish king was still occupied in the province of Moray, where
he appears to have assembled a considerable force, to which Ireland
contributed her share. Strengthened by the return of Thorkell Fostri,
and by the arrival of the friendly clans from the Highland districts
of the north and west, Thorfin crossed the Moray Firth, and assuming
the offensive, attacked the royal army, which is said to have been
stationed in the neighbourhood of Burghead.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Duncan was defeated
after a severe struggle, and Thorfin, following up his success,
plundered the country to the frontiers of Fife, and returned without
molestation to his northern earldom; whilst the double failure in
Northumbria and Moray hastening the catastrophe of the youthful king,
he was assassinated “in the Smith’s bothy,” near Elgin, not far from
the scene of his latest battle, the Mormaor Macbeth being the undoubted
author of his death.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>The reigns of this king and his predecessor have been adorned in the
pages of Buchanan and Boece with numerous victories gained over the
Northmen which were totally unknown to the earlier authorities Wynton
and Fordun. Many difficulties beset the path of the early compiler
of Scottish history. The dearth of materials; the English claims so
thoroughly interwoven with the accounts which the rival chronicler
was fain to accept for his principal authorities; the necessity under
which he lay of distinguishing the “genuine Scots”—as he considered
them—as well from the “Irishry” to the northward of “the Mounth,” as
from the English to the southward of the Tweed, all combined to render
it a matter requiring no little trouble and ingenuity to compose an
appropriate history of his country. Under these circumstances the
numerous tumuli along the coast, each marking some spot where the men
of the olden time repulsed or fell before the invaders, suggested
the groundwork of a historical fabric which might at any rate escape
much questioning; and of these memorials of bygone conflicts Boece
has availed himself without scruple. Lords of the Isles and Thanes of
Strathearn valiantly sustain the contest against Sueno or Camus, Olave
or Onetus; and at a time when surnames were as yet unknown, a Keith
or a Hay, a Graham or a Dunbar, revives the failing courage of his
countrymen and points the way to victory. The fate of Loncarty must
attend upon the triumphs of Malcolm and his grandson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> The crumbling
bones of the dead bear faithful witness to the reality of the battles,
but the circumstances and the characters called into existence by the
pen of Boece, must fade away from the page of history, and pass into
the realm of fiction.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Very few kings of so remote a period have attained to the undying
celebrity of Macbeth. As long as the English language endures, his name
will be as widely known as that of the great Alfred, his character will
retain the familiar features impressed on it by the magic genius of
Shakspeare, and it will be as impossible to disentangle the historical
personage from the weird being of romance, as to picture “the meek and
hoary Duncan,” a young and inexperienced prince, meeting his untimely
fate in the flower of youth.</p>

<p>The quaint verses of the prior of Lochleven have embodied some of
the tales and traditions handed down by the partizans of the rival
families; and it will create little surprise to find that in a state
of society in which “the rights of blood” were paramount, the stigma
of illegitimacy was freely cast upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> both competitors for the crown.
Wyntoun has recorded how Duncan, wearied with the chase, and separated
from his usual attendants, found rest and shelter within the humble
mill of Forteviot; how love bade the king return where chance had
shown the way; and how Malcolm, whose blood has flowed in the veins of
every English and Scottish king but Stephen, from the days of Henry
Beauclerc, sprung from this intrigue with the “milnare’s dowchtyr of
Fortewyot.” As the taint upon the blood of Malcolm was supposed to be
inherited from his mother, so the stain upon the pedigree of Macbeth
was attributed to the Mormaor’s father; and in the same old verses
it may be read how the mother of the Moray chieftain, wandering by
chance in the woods, met with “ane fayr man, nevyr nane sa fayre as
scho thowcht than,” and how Macbeth was born “the Dewil’s sone,” and
the inheritor of all his father’s evil propensities. As the talisman
of success was eventually upon the side of Malcolm, so the tales of
the tyranny and crimes of his antagonist increased and multiplied,
until they assumed the well-known form in the pages of Boece, which,
copied into the chronicle of Holinshed, attracted the notice of the
master-mind that has stamped the fiction with immortality.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>It may be gathered from the circumstances of his early life that
Macbeth did not attain even to the position of Mormaor without a
struggle. The two sons of Ruadhri—Roderic or Rory—the first known
member of the Moray family, succeeded according to the Gaelic custom,
Finlay filling the office of Tanist during the lifetime of his brother
Malbride. He was slain, as has been already mentioned, by his nephews,
who evidently intended to retain the right of succession within
their immediate branch of the family; Gilcomgain, who must have been
chosen Tanist on his brother’s accession to the Mormaordom, following
Malcolm to the exclusion of Finlay’s son, Macbeth, whose right to the
Tanistship was undoubted, and who must have thus found himself shut
out from the seniority to which he was fully entitled to aspire as
the representative of the junior branch of Rory’s family. The union
of Gilcomgain with a daughter of the MacAlpin family must have still
further strengthened his position, and as Macbeth is subsequently
entitled <i>Dux</i> by the contemporary Marianus, it may be conjectured
that if he filled the office of <i>Toshach</i>—Duke or Constable of
the kingdom—during the reign of Duncan, it may have been conferred
upon him originally as the natural opponent of the rival line of
Kenneth MacDuff, with which the kinsman who had supplanted him was
closely connected. The last two years of Malcolm’s reign, however,
witnessed the deaths of Gilcomgain and of his wife’s brother; and
though the name of the Mormaor’s enemy is not mentioned, it is hardly
possible to doubt, that when he was surprised and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> burnt with fifty of
his followers, it was the deed of Macbeth avenging the murder of his
father, and re-asserting his claim upon the Mormaorship. The subsequent
death of Boedhe’s son transferred his claims upon the throne to his
sister Gruoch, whose marriage with Macbeth reversed the position in
which the Mormaor had hitherto stood, and placed him in the position
of Gilcomgain. Henceforth his interest was closely bound up with the
family to which he had hitherto been hostile, though, had Duncan
been prosperous, his fidelity might have stood the test. It was the
disastrous career of this unfortunate prince which first seems to
have aroused the ambition of Macbeth; but even then his hostility was
secret. It was not in open battle that Duncan lost his life, nor was
the crown of Scotland the prize of the victor in a hard fought field,
the final scene in “the Smith’s bothy” being strongly suggestive of
treachery.</p>

<p>The historical Macbeth appears to have been an able monarch, and
religious after the fashion of the age, for his reign has been handed
down in tradition as an era of fertility and prosperity—generally
a sign of the ability of the ruler; and he is recorded with his
queen amongst the earliest benefactors of the Culdee society of
Lochleven.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> With their joint grant to the little priory is
associated the only historical mention of the true descent of the Lady
Gruoch; and the venerable Culdee who briefly registered their donation,
little thought that, in entering the simple notice, he was perpetuating
the sole record of the real nature of the claims of his benefactors
upon the throne they were accused of usurping. His liberality to the
poor of Rome is also mentioned by a contemporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> historian; but in
such a manner as to leave it a matter of doubt whether the king was
ever present in person at the Eternal City.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>For five years after the fall of Duncan his successful rival reigned in
peace, when an attempt was made by the adherents of the late king to
regain their lost ascendancy. <span class="sni">A. D. 1045.</span> The children of
Duncan were still in their infancy, and their cause was sustained by
their grandfather, Crinan, the aged abbot of Dunkeld; but his defeat
and death, “with nine times twenty warriors,” extinguished for a time
the hopes of the House of Atholl, and only served to secure the throne
more firmly in the power of Macbeth.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Seven years elapsed and
the fortunes of the House of Moray were still in the ascendant, when
several of the Confessor’s Norman favourites, <span class="sni">A. D. 1052.</span>
who were driven from England on the return of Earl Godwin, fled for
refuge beyond the Tweed,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and the asylum granted to the fugitives
at Macbeth’s Court may have afforded a pretext for the hostility of
Siward, who, two years later, invaded the dominions of the Scottish
king. <span class="sni">A. D. 1054.</span> The whole force of the Northumbrian
provinces collected around the banner of the Danish earl, and attacked
Macbeth on the day of “the Seven Sleepers;” <span class="sni">27th July.</span>
fifteen hundred of the Anglo-Danes fell in the contest, with the son
and nephew of the earl, but Siward gained the day, slew three thousand
of the enemy—the detested Normans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> amongst the number—and carried off
a booty unprecedented in the annals of Border warfare.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The great success of the Anglo-Danish earl is generally supposed to
have reinstated Malcolm on the throne, but no such inference can be
drawn from the accounts of contemporary writers, by whom no allusion
is made to the Scottish prince; the espousal of the suppliant’s cause
by the Confessor, and the directions given by the saintly king to
Siward to re-establish the heir of Duncan in his ancestral kingdom,
only appearing in the pages of the Anglo-Norman chroniclers for
the purpose of indirectly furthering the subsequent feudal claims
of the English kings. As the rout of the Scottish army before the
walls of Durham, and their subsequent contest with Thorfin Sigurdson
hastened the catastrophe of the first king of the House of Atholl,
so the unsuccessful issue of his encounter with Earl Siward may have
eventually proved fatal to the Mormaor; but Macbeth held his ground
for four years, and the grave had long closed over the Danish earl,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1058.</span> when the defeat and death of his former
antagonist at Lumphanan, in Aberdeenshire, removed the first obstacle
from the path of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> youthful Malcolm.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> For three or four months
the contest still continued to be maintained by Gilcomgain’s son
Lulach, the feeble successor of his able kinsman, until his death at
Essie in Strathbogie, where he is said to have been betrayed, or to
have lost his life through some stratagem of his enemies, put an end
for the time to the struggle between the rival houses, and the heir of
Duncan without further difficulty obtained possession of the vacant
throne.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="subhed smcap">The Line of Atholl Restored.</span></h2></div>

<h3><i>Malcolm the Third (Ceanmore).</i> 1058–1093.</h3>


<p>Three centuries had now elapsed since the conquests of the Pictish
Angus established the supremacy of his native province, and laid the
foundation of the future kingdom of Scotland. During the earlier
portion of this period no addition had been made to the territories
of the reigning family, the lords of the southern capital of
<i>Dunfothir</i> contenting themselves with the vague dignity of
“Ardrigh of Alban,” and with excluding from the privileges of “a royal
race” the rival chieftains of <i>Dundurn</i>. The incursions of the
Northmen, above all the conquests of Thorstein Olaveson, weakened the
power of the southern kingdom, and by exhibiting the almost forgotten
spectacle of a prince of Dundurn sharing the throne of Scotland with a
scion of the royal race, resuscitated the hopes of the northern tribes;
the deaths of three kings of the MacAlpin dynasty in the province
of Moray testifying to the obstinacy with which the people of that
district continued to resist the pretensions of the southern family to
the right of <i>Can</i> and <i>Cuairt</i> throughout the north. But
the rise of the Jarls of the Orkneys again turned the scale in favour
of the south, and from the time when the second Kenneth favoured the
claims of Thorfin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> family upon the mainland earldom of their maternal
ancestor, Forres ceased to be fatal to his race, and he was at leisure
to carry out his projects against the heir of Finella, and to make
the first actual addition to the territories of the Scottish kings by
bringing the eastern coasts into a more direct dependancy upon the
crown. The “Bishopric of the Scots,” co-extensive in jurisdiction with
the royal power, henceforth reached to the Dee, and the fatality to the
royal race was transferred to the eastern provinces; for the struggle
was no longer in the north until the old rivalry again broke out on the
rupture of the alliance with the Orkney Jarl.</p>

<p>The fatality attending the northern districts never seems to have
extended to the junior branch of the reigning dynasty, whose alliances
and expeditions were essentially connected with the south and west.
It was over Strath Clyde that Constantine endeavoured to extend his
influence; Northumbria was the province from which Indulf wrested
Edinburgh; whilst Lothian, or the British frontiers, were fatal to
Colin and his brother Eocha. Hence it may be gathered that they were
the southern branch of the ruling family, the possessions of the
kindred race of Constantine the First probably bringing the latter
into more immediate contact with the northern division of the nation.
Upon the extinction of the line of Aodh in the person of Constantine
the Third, Malcolm the Second appears as the leader of the southern
interest, and whilst the children of Kenneth MacDuff eventually became
connected with the hereditary enemies of their race, Malcolm, in
pursuance of the traditional policy of the south, allied himself with
the House of Atholl, annexed Strath Clyde to the crown, and followed up
the conquests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> Indulf, and the attempts of his own father, Kenneth,
upon the neighbouring possessions of the Northumbrian Ealdormen. The
preponderance of the south was greatly increased during his reign,
and as the conquests of Angus and his successors centred the royal
authority in one ruling family, so the great additions made to the
territory of the crown during the reign of Kenneth and his son Malcolm
fixed that authority in the House of Atholl. The northern policy of
these kings was reversed by their descendant Duncan, the result costing
him his crown and his life; but a period was now approaching when the
lengthened reign of an abler prince was to redeem the incapacity or
misfortunes of the first of his House, to extend the power of the crown
still further over the hostile provinces of the north, and to bequeath
to his descendants a more compact and powerful kingdom, which they were
destined gradually to knit together in the iron bonds of feudalism.</p>

<p>The early years of the reign of Malcolm have escaped the notice of the
chroniclers of his age, and there is nothing to be recorded beyond
the death of Thorfin Sigurdson, <span class="sni">A. D. 1064.</span> when the
dominions of the Jarl reverted to his two sons, whilst Ingebiorge,
his widow, became the wife of the youthful king.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Ever since the
days of Ethelred and Edwin, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> princes of Deira and the race
of Ida contended for the dominion of Northumbria, the territories of
the Picts and Scots had afforded a frequent asylum to all whom the
chances of war or of political intrigue banished from the land of
the Saxon; but in the troubled and distracted period then impending
over England, the neighbouring kingdom beyond the Tweed was destined
to receive a band of more than usually illustrious exiles. The first
amongst the fugitives who sought the protection of the Scottish king
was Tosti, Earl of Yorkshire and Northumberland. <span class="sni">A. D.
1061.</span> A friendship had long existed between the king and the earl,
who were united in the bonds of “sworn brotherhood,” a tie which seems
to have been no obstacle to the attacks of Malcolm upon the earldom of
his sworn brother when the latter was absent upon a pilgrimage to Rome;
though it may have softened the resentment of the earl, who passed over
unnoticed this foray on the people of his earldom, whom he plundered
and oppressed, on his own part, with scarcely less hostility, under a
show of rightful authority. At length in the autumn of 1065 the whole
of the north of England rose against their earl, put to death the
ministers of his tyranny—descendants of the Anglo-Danes—and chose
Morkar, the brother of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, in his place; whilst
Tosti, escaping with difficulty from the first outbreak of their fury,
took refuge with his wife at the Court of Flanders. Here he organized a
plan for winning back his earldom, and sailing along the English coasts
in the following March, he swept some booty from the Isle of Wight,
but failing in an attempt to plunder Lindesey, where he was met and
defeated by his rival Morkar, he was obliged to seek the protection of
his old ally Malcolm. The Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> king, however, does not appear to
have shared in the intrigues of Tosti, nor did he take any part in the
memorable expedition of the Earl and Harald Hardrade against England,
resulting, <span class="sni">A. D. 1066.</span> as is well known, in the defeat and
death of both invaders in the battle of Stamford Bridge.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Some years elapsed after his victory at Hastings before the power
of the conqueror was thoroughly established throughout the northern
provinces of England, and even then it is doubtful whether it ever
extended, except in a qualified degree, over the modern county of
Cumberland, or over Northumbria beyond the Tyne.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> He was well aware
of the secret disaffection existing amongst the magnates of his new
people, but it formed no part of his policy to drive them in a body
into open rebellion, and they were retained in a species of honourable
captivity at his court, or accompanied him in his expeditions into
Normandy—nominally indeed as dignified retainers, but in reality as
hostages for the peace of their respective districts—whilst year after
year saw one or more of the nobles of English birth incarcerated or
put to death on one pretext or another. The vengeance of William might
be postponed, but it was never forgotten, nor did he ever pass over an
opportunity of crushing the man whom his sagacious but unsparing policy
had once marked as dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1068.</div>

<p>It was to avoid some such ebullition of William’s wrath, that, in the
summer of 1068, Edgar the Atheling, with his mother and two sisters,
and many of the northern lords who had supported his claims after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the death of Harold, deemed it expedient to cross the borders into
Scotland. There appears to have been an abortive attempt at a rising
in that year in which the fugitives may have been implicated, and, to
curb the disaffection of the men of Morkar’s earldom, William built two
castles at York, garrisoning them with a strong detachment of Norman
soldiery. <span class="sni">A. D. 1069.</span> In the ensuing winter he dispatched
Robert Comyn, the first of a name destined to become celebrated in
the annals of the neighbouring kingdom, to preserve order amongst the
turbulent Northumbrians beyond the Tyne; <span class="sni">28th Jan.</span> but the
Norman baron was surprised and slain at Durham, before he reached his
earldom, out of seven hundred of his followers but one escaping with
life. The perpetrators of this outrage then marched upon York, taking
with them Edgar, who had joined them from Scotland, and were entering
into a negotiation with the citizens of that place, when they were
discomfited by the sudden arrival of William from the south, who gave
up the city to be plundered, as a punishment for the disaffection of
its inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>The arrival of two hundred and forty ships in the Humber, under the
command of Jarl Osbern, the Danish king’s brother, summoned Edgar and
his partizans in the following autumn to make one more effort to free
their native land from the Norman yoke, even at the cost of delivering
it to the Danes; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> the united armies, marching upon York, stormed
the two Norman castles, putting more than three thousand soldiers to
the sword, when the Danes, satisfied with the amount of their success,
returned at once to their ships, whilst Edgar and his adherents lost no
time in again retiring beyond the Tyne. On receiving the intelligence
of the destruction of his castles, and the lamentable slaughter of his
men, William swore to exact a fearful vengeance, and with unflinching
rigour he fulfilled his oath. He soon discovered the proper weapons for
combating Jarl Osbern, who was ready to sacrifice the interest of his
brother for his own personal emolument; and it was secretly arranged
that the hostilities of the Danish admiral should be limited during
the winter to pillaging the coast, and that in the following spring he
should return to Denmark without offering any serious opposition to the
movements of the Norman king. Secure against attack from Jarl Osbern,
William marched to the north, giving over the whole country between
the Humber and the Tyne throughout the ensuing winter to the unbridled
license of his soldiery.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1070.</div>

<p>With the approach of spring he returned to the south, to institute
a searching and rigorous scrutiny into the coffers of the English
monasteries; but scarcely were the inhabitants of the devastated
provinces relieved from the presence of the Norman army, than they were
destined to experience a repetition of their sufferings from a sudden
invasion of the Scots. In the confusion of the period Malcolm had
seized upon Cumberland, retaining it hitherto by open force, and its
possession enabling him to penetrate into England without crossing the
territories of his Northumbrian allies, he poured his followers down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
the Vale of Teesdale into the North Riding of Yorkshire. At a spot
known as “the Hundred Springs,” long since covered by the luxuriant
woods of Castle Howard, he reached the limits of his incursion, and
dispatching homewards a portion of the army laden with the plunder of
the expedition, he sought to entice the population of the districts
which had hitherto been spared, from the caves and forests to which
they had hurriedly fled on the first tidings of his inroad. The
stratagem of the Scottish leader was only too successful, and the
miserable inhabitants of Cleveland, Hartness, and the eastern coasts
of Durham, were soon startled from their fancied security by the
unexpected approach of the very army which they had vainly imagined to
have quitted the country, and to have been already far advanced on its
homeward march towards the north.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>By this time, however, the confederates, in whose behalf Malcolm had
taken up arms, had ceased to be formidable to the English king. The
Danish fleet, after plundering Peterborough, quitted the English coasts
in June; and Osbern, meeting with his just reward, was banished from
the court of his indignant brother Sweyne. Not a few of the insurgents
had already made their peace with William—a similar transaction to
that which had corrupted Osbern, purchasing for Cospatric the Earldom
of Northumberland, on which he had claims through the descent of his
mother from Earl Uchtred. The rest of the Northumbrian leaders were
preparing to leave a country in which they could now no longer hope
to dwell in safety; and Malcolm, upon his arrival at Wearmouth, found
a vessel in the harbour with the Atheling on board, who, with his
mother and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> sisters, Siward Beorn, Merlesweyne, and others of his
most faithful adherents, was only awaiting a favourable wind to quit
for ever his native land. The Scottish king hastened to assure the
illustrious exiles of a welcome reception at his own court, and his
offer of an asylum was readily accepted, though the courtesy of Malcolm
towards the representatives of Anglo-Saxon royalty tended very little
to alleviate the sufferings of their subjects. The work of destruction
proceeded as before, and the king was contemplating the burning ruins
of St. Peter’s Church, fired by his own retainers, when intelligence
arrived that Earl Cospatric was signalizing his newly-born fidelity
to the English king at the expense of the Scottish possessions in
Cumberland. The fury of Malcolm knew no bounds; but a few months
had elapsed since Scotland had sheltered Cospatric from William’s
vengeance; and her king, during his recent inroad, had purposely
abstained from any outrage upon the territory of Northumberland.
Hitherto plunder had been the object of the Scottish army, but
henceforth their aim was revenge; and though the walls of Bamborough
sheltered Cospatric with the spoils of wasted Cumberland, his earldom
was open to fire and sword, and dearly did its devoted inhabitants
rue the untoward zeal with which their earl had repaid his recent
appointment. No mercy was shown to either age, sex, or infancy; all who
escaped the massacre were driven in crowds along the homeward path of
the invaders; and though multitudes of the captives perished miserably
by the way, enough survived to satisfy the cupidity of their captors,
and to supply every hovel beyond the Borders with slaves of English
race.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<p>An incalculable amount of misery and loss of human life resulted from
these northern wars; for not a village was left standing between York
and Durham, nor for nine years was any attempt made at cultivation over
a space of sixty miles and upwards. <i>Waste</i> is the term ominously
affixed in Domesday to all the possessions of Edwin, Morkar, and the
northern prelates, as well as to the lands of Waltheof and Cospatric,
of Siward Beorn, and Merlesweyne; and a province, once flourishing
and prosperous, became the haunt of beasts of prey, wild cattle, and
outlaws. To add still more to the wretchedness of the period, a partial
dearth, which had arisen from the ravages of William, was increased
by the events of the two succeeding years, until it became a famine
of the most intense description. Many sold themselves to slavery to
escape starvation; others were reduced to support life by the most
revolting substitutes for their accustomed food, such as carrion and
human flesh; houses and streets were filled with the unburied bodies
of the dead, none stopping to perform the last offices of interment;
and the roadsides were covered with dying wretches, perishing in a vain
attempt to seek a refuge in exile. Multitudes of every class abandoned
their native land during this frightful period of misery and despair;
Scotland became their asylum and adopted home, and in the veins of many
of the bravest and noblest of her sons, there flowed, in after times,
the best and purest blood of ancient Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>An additional stimulus must have been afforded to this emigration by
the union of Malcolm, after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> return from the south, with Margaret,
one of the sisters of the Atheling. History has left no record of the
fate of Ingebiorge, and possibly she was no longer living, though her
death is by no means necessarily to be implied from the second marriage
of Malcolm, as a laxity in the dissolution of the marriage tie was
not confined to the Gaelic people alone at that period.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Margaret
is said to have been at first averse to the marriage, not for any
personal dislike to her future husband, but because the misfortunes
of her country and of her family had sunk deeply into her heart,
inclining her to seek a refuge in the cloister, to which her sister
Christina subsequently retired. But the advantages of the connection
with the Scottish king were too obvious to be overlooked; her scruples
were at length overcome by her brother and his followers, and her
gentle disposition and sincere piety were destined to exercise a mild
and beneficent influence over the characters of her husband and her
youthful family.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The English king was occupied during the following year in repressing
the rebellion of Edwin and Morkar, <span class="sni">A. D. 1071.</span>and in
crushing the attempt made by the latter earl to maintain a stand in
conjunction with Hereward, Siward Beorn, and Aylwyn bishop of Durham,
amid the fens and marshes surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> Ely; but the invasion of Malcolm
was neither forgotten nor forgiven, and towards the close of the next
summer <span class="sni">A. D. 1072. August.</span> William marched to the north
with a formidable array of mounted chivalry, supported by a numerous
fleet, in the full determination of exacting vengeance, both for the
open hostility of the Scottish king, and for the support invariably
afforded in the same quarter to his disaffected subjects beyond the
Humber. If he had expected to find any of the insurgents in Scotland,
he was doomed, on this occasion, to disappointment, as they had
undoubtedly escaped elsewhere on the first rumours of the magnitude of
the expedition.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Edgar was apparently in Flanders,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> a country
which, ever since the accession of Robert the Frison, had become
the asylum of all who fled from the wrath of the Conqueror; as the
connection of the count, by marriage, with the Danish and French kings,
both at enmity with the king of England, as well as the assistance
rendered by William to the nephew of Robert in his attempts upon
the appanage of his uncle, caused a ready welcome to be accorded in
Flanders to all who were disposed to assist the count in his attacks
upon the duchy of Normandy.</p>

<p>When William had penetrated as far as Abernethy in the county of
Fife<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> he was met by the army of his adversary; but as neither
king was really anxious to proceed to extremities, before long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> they
mutually agreed to the following arrangement. Malcolm received a grant
of certain manors in England, with the promise of a yearly payment of
twelve marks of gold, performing the usual homage in return for the
grant of English fiefs, and giving up Duncan, his son by his former
marriage, as a hostage for the fulfilment of his obligations.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
The Conqueror then retraced his steps to the south. His predominance
in the north at length established, Cospatric could be safely taxed,
both with his alleged connivance in the death of Robert Comyn, and
with his actual presence at the storm of the castles of York. Neither
of these charges had interfered with his advancement to the earldom
of Northumberland when it had been the aim of William to detach
a formidable opponent from the ranks of his enemies; nor did his
innocence of the first crime avail him now, and his fief was given to
Waltheof, whose feats at York upon the same occasion, where he long
defended the gate with his single arm, cutting down the Normans one
after another as they entered, were for the present either pardoned
or overlooked. Cospatric escaped by a timely flight, and after a
brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> residence in Flanders, rejoined his countrymen in Scotland,
where he received from Malcolm, who seems to have forgotten his former
resentment against the Earl, the important fortress of Dunbar with an
ample portion of the surrounding territory, and he became the ancestor
of the noble family of Dunbar, long prominent amongst the barons of
southern Scotland as Earls of Lothian or the March.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1073.</div>

<p>Not long after the treaty of Abernethy, Edgar returned from the
continent to Scotland, where, though he was received with every mark
of honour and respect by his sister and her husband, Malcolm earnestly
pressed upon him the advantage of accepting the castle of Montreuil,
offered by the king of France for the purpose of establishing a
troublesome neighbour in the vicinity of the Norman possessions of
their mutual foe. Edgar accordingly once more left Scotland laden
with the costly presents of his relatives, but like most men of his
character the Atheling was doomed to misfortune, and ere long Scotland
again received him, a shipwrecked and homeless wanderer. It was no
part of the policy of Malcolm to risk the vengeance of the Conqueror
in fruitless attempts at assisting his feeble brother-in-law, and
he now strongly advised him to tender his submission to the English
king. It was accepted most willingly; and with much empty ceremony and
parade, Edgar was conducted to the English frontier, and from thence to
Normandy, where he resigned his pretensions to the English crown, and
passed the remainder of his life, for the most part, in indolent and
peaceful insignificance.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>Every cause for hostility between the English and Scottish kings was
removed for a time by the relinquishment of Edgar’s claims upon the
English crown, and Malcolm was at liberty to turn his attention to
internal policy, and to establish his authority, and secure it more
firmly, over the northern provinces of his dominions. The deaths of
Macbeth, and of his successor Lulach, had crushed without extinguishing
the hopes of the rival family; but though their pretensions were again
revived by Lulach’s son Malsnechtan, fortune continued adverse to
the men of Moray, and a sanguinary and decisive victory, <span class="sni">
A. D. 1077.</span> in which Malcolm is said to have “won the mother of
Malsnechtan, all his best men, his treasures and his cattle,” confirmed
the superiority of the king. This solitary passage in the Saxon
chronicle is the only indication of the occurrence of any contest in
the north of Scotland during the course of Malcolm’s reign; though
probably the battle thus recorded by the chronicler of a different
people, who adds that, “God’s justice was done upon Malsnechtan, for
he was all forsworn,” effectually established the royal authority over
the dominions of the hostile Mormaors. Malsnechtan, indeed, survived
his overthrow to “die in peace,” a few years afterwards, <span class="sni">
A. D. 1085.</span> when the title of “king of Moray,” conferred upon him by
the Irish annalist, implies (if correct) a partial independence; but
as there can be no doubt about the foundation of Mortlach before the
date of his death, the surrounding territory must have been by this
time annexed to the crown, and the influence of the Moray family must
henceforth have been confined to the westward of the Spey.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1079.</div>

<p>Two years after his successes in the north Malcolm again crossed his
southern frontiers with a hostile army; and, as at the time of this
inroad William was contending in Normandy against his eldest son, it
is doubtful whether the incursion was intended to effect a diversion
in favour of Robert, always a warm friend of the Scottish monarch,
or whether it was simply dictated, in the absence of the English
king, by a wish to sweep the country to the Tyne. William was very
shortly reconciled with his son, whom he dispatched with an army in
the following autumn <span class="sni">A. D. 1080.</span> to make reprisals for the
invasion of the Scots; but either from a want of ability, or from a
secret feeling in favour of Malcolm, Robert retreated without effecting
anything beyond a fruitless march to Falkirk; on his return southwards
laying the foundations of a new castle on the Tyne—the first link in
the chain of border fortresses destined to defend the English frontier
from the ever ready attacks of the Scots—around which the future
capital of Northumberland eventually grew into existence.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1087.</div>

<p>The two king’s were never destined to meet again. The stern soul of the
Conqueror was touched upon his deathbed with some feelings of remorse
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> the numerous captives whom he had so long retained in hopeless
confinement, and he left directions to his sons to release, after his
death, all prisoners of state, and others whom motives of policy had
hitherto kept under restraint. Amongst the hostages set at liberty were
Malcolm’s son Duncan, and Ulf the son of Harold, whose good fortune
made Robert the arbiter of their fate; and the Duke of Normandy, with
an honourable regard for the wishes of the dead, not only carried out
the intentions of his deceased father, but conferred upon them both
the dignity of knighthood, dismissing them with presents and marks of
honour from his court; whilst the other prisoners, less fortunate, were
retained in close custody by Rufus.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1091.</div>

<p>Four years after the death of the Conqueror, when the contest between
his sons was brought to a temporary conclusion upon the pacification
between William and Robert, Edgar the Atheling was expelled from the
lands assigned to him in Normandy by the late king, and was once
more driven to seek a refuge in Scotland. Malcolm again espoused his
cause, and partly, perhaps, in the hope of enforcing by a hostile
demonstration the restoration of the Conqueror’s grant of manors, which
appears to have been withheld by his successor, he marched a numerous
army across the frontier in early spring, advancing as far as Chester
le Street on his route to Durham; but upon learning that the whole
country was in arms to oppose his progress, he lost no time, as his
purpose was anticipated, in returning at once to Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Intelligence of this fruitless inroad reaching William in Normandy,
determined his return to England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> and crossing the Channel with his
brother Robert, he dispatched a powerful fleet along the coast, and
prepared to follow in his father’s footsteps, and to march with his
Norman chivalry to the north. But the English king had miscalculated
the difficulties he would have to encounter, and though the summer was
already far advanced before he returned to England, unlike his politic
predecessor, who was always capable of postponing his vengeance to the
proper season, he pushed forward his preparations for an immediate
attack upon his enemy. Michaelmas passed away before he commenced his
march, and when he reached the north, towards the close of autumn, his
fleet was dispersed by a violent storm, and many of his horses had
perished from cold and hunger in traversing the wastes yet stamped with
the traces of his father’s vengeance. Instead of declining a contest as
before, Malcolm, who was aware of his adversary’s situation, advanced
into Lothian to meet the invaders; but a collision was prevented by
the intervention of Robert, who, sending for the Atheling from the
Scottish camp, arranged, with his assistance, a renewal of the treaty
of Abernethy. Edgar was reconciled to William on the same occasion,
accompanying him to England on his return to the south; but before
Christmas both Robert and the Atheling retired in disgust from the
English court, as the promises of the king remained in every case
unfulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1092.</div>

<p>Another bulwark against the inroads of the Scots was erected in
the following year, when William, marching into Cumberland, or
<i>Northumbria</i> as it is called by the northern chroniclers, drove
out Dolfin, who then possessed the land, and rebuilt and fortified
Carlisle, which had lain in ruins since the days of Halfdan, peopling
the neighbourhood with a body of peasantry collected from other parts
of the country.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> In spite of the non-fulfilment of William’s
promises, Malcolm had as yet proceeded to no open act of hostility,
and many of the leading men in England were anxious to carry out
the intentions of Robert, and to secure a firm and lasting peace on
terms honourable to both kings, and beneficial to their respective
subjects. The illness of William in the year after his expedition
into Cumberland, appeared a favourable opportunity for effecting
an arrangement, as the fear of approaching death had softened the
harshness of his character, and inclined him to listen to the
entreaties of his advisers, who urgently implored him to repair his
previous injustice; and accordingly, when Malcolm sent to demand the
completion of their treaty, William named Gloucester as the place of
meeting, delivered hostages for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> safety of the Scottish king during
his absence from his own country, and deputed Edgar Atheling to conduct
his relative with all befitting honour to the English court.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1093. 11th Aug.</div>

<p>In his progress towards the south Malcolm assisted at the foundation
of a new church at Durham, and his presence at the ceremony marks the
connection which appears to have grown up since the annexation of
Lothian—and still more since the marriage of Margaret—between the
inhabitants of the northern counties and their Scottish neighbours,
before the frontier line of fortresses springing up along the borders
effectually severed the last links connecting the divisions of the
ancient Bernician kingdom. <span class="sni">24th Aug.</span> Towards the close
of August he arrived at Gloucester, but William was no longer on
a bed of sickness, and his transient penitence, with the apparent
amelioration in his character, having passed away on the return of
health, Malcolm found the English king more haughty and exacting than
ever. Admission to the royal presence was contemptuously denied him,
and he was commanded to “do right” in the English court, and according
to the judgment of the English barons alone. To have yielded to this
demand would have at once placed the king of Scotland on a footing
with the English barons as “his Peers,” and would have been tantamount
to an admission of his absolute and unconditional dependence upon the
English crown. Exasperated at the affront, Malcolm indignantly refused
compliance, promptly asserting “that the kings of Scotland were wont
to do right to the kings of England upon the frontiers of the two
kingdoms, and according to the united judgment of the Peers of both
realms;” and having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> thus maintained his entire independence of the
English king, he departed in open hostility from his court.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Hastily collecting an army on his return to his own country, Malcolm
again crossed the frontier before the close of autumn, and in spite of
the warnings of his anxious queen, <span class="sni">November.</span> headed his
followers in person to revenge upon the soil of England the insult of
her haughty sovereign. The forebodings of Margaret were destined to
be too fatally fulfilled, Malcolm perishing on the 13th of November
on the banks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> the river Alne; and although the manner of his death
is involved in some obscurity, there is little doubt that it was
effected by treachery. His ostensible opponent was Robert de Mowbray,
at that time Earl of Northumberland, but the death-blow was dealt by
Morel of Bamborough, to whom he had once been bound by the ties of the
closest and most familiar friendship.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Edward, the eldest of the
sons of Margaret, and acknowledged as his father’s heir, fell mortally
wounded on the same fatal occasion, dying a few days afterwards at
a place in Jedwood forest long known as “Edward’s Isle;” whilst the
Scottish host, dismayed at their double loss, returned in confusion
to their own country, many perishing by the sword in their disorderly
flight, but more losing their lives in attempting to cross the rivers
swollen into torrents at that late season of the year. The body of
the king, abandoned by his followers, was found upon the field of
battle by two peasants, who cast it carelessly on a cart and brought
it into Tynemouth, where the royal corpse was consigned to an obscure
tomb—a judgment, in the eyes of the historian of Durham, for the
injuries inflicted by the living king on that very place—until about
twenty years afterwards, when it was removed by the filial piety of
the first Alexander to his native land, and the ashes of the warlike
Malcolm at length reposed in peace by the side of his sainted queen in
Dunfermline.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Thus died Malcolm Ceanmore in the six-and-thirtieth year of a long
and prosperous reign. An able king, and a bold and fearless warrior,
the traits that have been preserved of his private character evince
the kindliness of disposition, and the frank generosity, which not
unfrequently adorn so gracefully the character of a brave man. Though
as ignorant of letters as most of his contemporaries, he loved to
choose the books which were the favourite study of his queen, and to
cause them to be emblazoned with gold and jewels as a testimony of his
affection and esteem; and when in the exercise of the lavish almsgiving
for which the royal Margaret was renowned, she would unhesitatingly
resort to the personal property of the king, after exhausting her own
resources, Malcolm, on discovering his loss, would merely tax her
laughingly with the theft.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> According to an anecdote related by
his son David, he once received an intimation that a nobleman, whose
arrival at court was daily expected, had agreed with his enemies
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> attempt his assassination. Strict secrecy was enjoined upon the
informant, and on the appearance of the visitor a royal hunt was
proclaimed; the king contriving, in assigning his position to each
sportsman, to separate himself from all the party with the exception
of the suspected noble, whom he then taxed with his intended crime,
bidding him on the spot, where there was none to see or to interfere,
enact the part of a brave foe rather than of a base and cowardly
assassin. Overwhelmed with shame and remorse, the nobleman threw
himself at the feet of his intended victim, entreating forgiveness for
his treachery; and the pardon was as freely bestowed by the generous
king as the combat on equal terms had been frankly proffered.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The history of Malcolm’s career would be incomplete without an allusion
to one who exercised so great an influence over his court and people
as Queen Margaret. Firmly convinced of the infallibility of his queen,
whom he appears to have regarded as the incarnation of all that was
pure and holy upon earth, the king submitted to her guidance implicitly
in all matters connected with religion; and Margaret, conscious of her
own learning and eloquence, and perhaps not unwilling to display her
undoubted talents, frequently summoned the clergy to meet in council,
and laid before them her opinions on the state of the Scottish church;
Malcolm on such occasions acting as interpreter, and supporting her
views<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> on ecclesiastical subjects with all the weight of his own
temporal authority.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Her piety was fervent and sincere, though
imbued with much of the formalism of the age. Every morning a certain
number of poor were ranged in front of the palace, and it was the
first daily duty of the king and queen to wash their feet, and to
supply them with food and clothing. Every night Margaret arose for
midnight prayer, and the severity of the discipline to which she chose
to subject herself, laid the foundation of a painful and lingering
disease which eventually shortened her life. But her influence was not
confined to matters of religion alone, and it was through Margaret
that pomp and ceremonial were first introduced at the Scottish court,
the king no longer riding out without a royal escort, nor regaling his
nobility in the rude fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> of his ancestors, but astonishing them
with a display of gold and silver plate.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> A corresponding degree
of magnificence was encouraged amongst the courtiers, foreign traders
were invited to bring their rich and varied wares to Scottish ports,
whilst it was signified that all who wished to earn the royal favour
must become purchasers of the costly novelties.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In short, to the
influence of Margaret may be attributed the foundation of that change,
which gradually converted the king of Scotland from a rude and simple
chieftain, surrounded by congenial and semi-barbarous followers, into
a feudal monarch in the midst of a knightly and chivalrous court.
The impress of her character is very visible in the dispositions and
qualities of her children; and if from her they inherited the love
of ostentation and display, which seems to have been the foible of
their amiable mother, it must not be forgotten that from her also they
derived the purity of life for which they were all alike distinguished,
and which was so eminent a feature in the character of a queen, in
whose presence not even a word that could give offence was ever known
to have been uttered.</p>

<p>The disastrous intelligence of the battle reached Margaret after her
health had been long impaired, less by age, for she was scarcely
past the prime of life, than by a painful disorder brought on by the
austerities of the fasts, and penances, dictated by her fervent though
mistaken piety. The departure of the king with her elder sons, upon
their last unfortunate expedition, had already oppressed her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> with
a gloomy foreshadowing of the future; and when, on the third day after
the catastrophe, her son Edgar stood by her couch, in his expressive
silence she divined her loss, and bowed in submission to the blow.
But the shock was too great for her enfeebled frame, and sinking at
once under the intelligence, upon the same day on which the fatal
tidings arrived, she calmly and peacefully breathed her last, and death
released her from her sorrows.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Six sons and two daughters were the offspring of the marriage between
Malcolm and Margaret. Edward, the eldest, perished with his father, and
Ethelred, created Abbot of Dunkeld and Earl of Fife, appears to have
survived his parents for a very short time: Edmund died in an English
cloister, a penitent and mysterious recluse; Edgar, Alexander, and
David, lived to wear, in succession, the crown of Scotland. Of the two
daughters, Editha was destined by Malcolm to be the wife of Alan, Count
of Bretagne, but she eventually became the queen of Henry of England,
who had long been attached to the Scottish princess, and claimed her
as his bride immediately upon his accession to the throne. Many blamed
Archbishop Anselm for countenancing the marriage, as they believed that
Editha had taken the vows of a nun; but she convinced the archbishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
of their mistake, and her words throw a curious light on the severe
discipline to which she was subjected under the rule of her mother’s
sister, the stern abbess of Romsey, as well as on the perils to which
even a lady of her exalted rank was exposed, in these stormy times,
from the licence of the Norman conquerors.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> “I never took the
veil,” said the princess, “but when I was quite a young girl, trembling
under the rod of my aunt Christina, whom you must recollect, she used
to place a little black hood on my head, to protect me from the lawless
insolence of the Normans; and when I tore it off she would beat me
cruelly, scolding me during the punishment in the harshest language. So
in her presence I wore the black hood in tears and trembling; but when
my father saw it he would pluck it from my head in a rage, imprecating
the wrath of Heaven on the hand that placed it there, and adding that
he intended me for Count Alan’s bride, and not for a sisterhood of
nuns.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> She changed her name to Matilda in compliment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> to her
husband’s mother, and her memory was long venerated amongst the English
people, who fondly remembered her as “good Queen Maud.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Mary, the
younger daughter, after the marriage of her sister with Henry, was
united to Eustace, Count of Boulogne, by whom she left an only child,
also named Matilda, the heiress of her father’s earldom, which she
brought as her dowry to Stephen of Blois, afterwards king of England.</p>

<p>The lamentable occurrence on the banks of the Alne threw all Scotland
into confusion, retarding the progress of the country for the next
quarter of a century. Edward had been chosen by his father for his
Tanist, or successor, in preference to his elder half-brother Duncan,
probably because, as the eldest of the sons of Margaret, he united
her claims upon the allegiance of the Anglo-Saxons to his own right
to the fealty of the native Scots; but the illegitimacy of Duncan is
not necessarily to be inferred from the course pursued by Malcolm, for
the ideas of that period about inheritance were not of the fixed and
unvarying character which the custom of centuries has established in
the present and preceding ages. The race of Alfred occupied the English
throne to the exclusion of the children of his elder brother, nor
did the descendants of the great king succeed in the lineal order of
after-times. The claims of the Atheling were disregarded by the Saxon
Harold, as well as by the Norman William; Robert was equally set aside
by both his brothers; whilst Henry’s daughter, Matilda, was obliged to
support her right to the crown by force of arms against the pretensions
of her cousin the heir-male, himself a younger son. This uncertainty
about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span> rightful heir will explain the care with which the kings
of that age thought it necessary to secure the recognition of their
successors during their own lifetime. The elder Henry assembled the
magnates of his dominions to acknowledge the claims of his son William,
and at a subsequent period those of his daughter Matilda; whilst his
grandson, the first Plantagenet, celebrated in his own lifetime the
coronation of his eldest son, a proceeding of which he lived most
bitterly to repent. The name of David was associated, as the successor
of the reigning monarch, with that of his brother Alexander in the
grant to St. Andrews of the <i>Cursus apri</i>; that of the Scottish
prince, Henry, is to be found in many charters as the heir-elect of
his father; whilst the names of William the Lion, and of David of
Huntingdon, are of frequent occurrence, under the same circumstances,
as late as the commencement of the thirteenth century. In Scotland such
a custom was peculiarly desirable, where the early usage, extending the
right of election to the crown to every member of the royal family,
rendered the nomination of a Tanist during the lifetime of the reigning
sovereign a matter of absolute necessity, to prevent anarchy and
confusion after his decease.</p>

<p>Three parties may be said to have divided Scotland at the period of
Malcolm’s death. In the north, the partizans of the house of Moray,
crushed by the decisive victory gained by the late king over Lulach’s
son Malsnechtan, were in no condition to sustain the pretensions of any
member of his family to the vacant throne. Along the eastern coast,
and in the south, the supporters of the reigning family were divided
between the national and foreign factions; the former composed of the
hereditary adherents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> of the house of Atholl, mostly of pure Gaelic
or of Scoto-British descent; the latter of the refugees from England,
and probably of the descendants of the ancient Northumbrians of the
Lothians. The influence of Margaret at her husband’s court, as well
as motives of policy, had induced Malcolm to show especial favour to
the countrymen of his queen, thus implanting the seeds of a bitter
feeling of hostility in the breasts of many of the Scottish nobles at
a line of conduct exhibiting, as they thought, an undue partiality for
the Saxons and their innovations. The smothered enmity of the Scots
blazed forth after the death of the king, and the haste and secrecy
with which the body of the royal Margaret was removed by Ethelred
to its last resting-place, discloses the existence amongst many of
her contemporaries of a feeling of antipathy against the <i>Saxon
Queen</i>, widely different from the enthusiastic veneration paid
by their descendants to the memory of the <i>Royal Saint</i>.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
The election of Donald Bane to his brother’s throne was the natural
consequence of this wide-spread jealousy, <span class="sni">A. D. 1093.</span> as
well as of a reactionary feeling in favour of the ancient national
usage, according to which he was undoubtedly the rightful heir; and the
immediate expulsion of the detested <i>Saxons</i> followed upon the
triumph of the national party.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>The state of Scotland had not been unnoticed at the court of the
English king, where Duncan appears to have resided, ever since the
death of the Conqueror, in an equivocal position between a guest and a
hostage. Brought from his native country at a very early age, he had
imbibed the ideas of a feudal baron, and when Robert conferred upon
him the honour of knighthood, after his liberation from his former
captivity, the youthful knight preferred remaining at a court to which
he was accustomed from his infancy, to returning to a country of which
he knew but little, and where he may have feared a doubtful reception.
Presenting himself before William, on learning the accession of his
uncle, he requested the grant of his fathers kingdom, promising to hold
it in fealty and allegiance in return for the king’s assistance. This
was readily accorded on the terms of the petitioner; <span class="sni">A.D.
1094.</span> and when the return of spring favoured the march of an army,
Duncan, placing himself at the head of a band of English and Norman
auxiliaries, drove out his uncle Donald and took possession of the
kingdom. The Scots appear to have been taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> by surprise, for upon
recovering from their first astonishment, they at once returned in
sufficient force to overwhelm the followers of Duncan, putting most of
them to the sword; but as their hostility was confined to the foreign
soldiery, and they entertained no personal antipathy to a member of
Malcolm’s family, they readily permitted Duncan to retain the crown on
condition of introducing no more aliens into the country.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The temporary success of Duncan appears to have thrown Donald Bane upon
the support of a partizan of the northern faction, and he enlisted in
his behalf the assistance of Malpeter MacLoen, the Mormaor of Mærne;
whilst another party to his conspiracy for regaining the crown was
Edmund, one of the surviving sons of Malcolm and Margaret, who was
to be rewarded for his connivance in the death of his half-brother
by sharing the royal power with his uncle Donald. Their intrigues
were only too successful, and the treacherous slaughter of Duncan
at Monachedin on the banks of the Bervie, where a rude stone still
marks the supposed locality of his death, reinstated Donald, after an
interval of six months, whilst the surviving followers of his murdered
nephew were slain or driven from the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The second reign of Donald lasted without opposition for three years,
but it would be impossible to say whether Edmund shared the throne,
for a veil of mystery has been thrown over all his actions. During
this period the remaining children of Malcolm were exiles from their
native land, whilst William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> was occupied in fruitless wars with the
Welsh, in reducing the too powerful de Mowbray of Northumberland,
and in negotiating with his brother Robert the purchase of the duchy
of Normandy. <span class="sni">A. D. 1097.</span> At length towards the close of
the year in which the Saxon chronicler laments over “the grievous
oppression of the people who were driven up from the country districts
to London, to work at the wall they were building about the Tower,
and the Bridge, and the King’s Hall at Westminster, whereby many
perished,”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Edgar Atheling was dispatched to Scotland, and, after
a severe struggle, he succeeded in placing his eldest nephew Edgar
upon the throne, under similar conditions to the terms imposed upon
Duncan.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Donald, falling into the victor’s power, was treated with
the severity of a cruel age, and was sentenced to pass the remainder
of his days, in blindness and in chains, at Roscolpie or Rescobie in
Forfarshire; whilst his confederate Edmund, the only degenerate son of
Malcolm and Margaret, seems to have adopted a course which saved his
own life, and preserved the honour of the family. He expiated his crime
by assuming the cowl at Montague, a Cluniac Priory in Somersetshire;
and the honourable imprisonment of the princely monk in the retirement
of a distant cloister, so effectually obliterated the recollection
of his treason amongst the people of his native land, that a halo of
peculiar sanctity gradually encircled his memory, and he was handed
down to posterity as a man of more than ordinary holiness. Such a
reputation must, for obvious reasons, have been favoured by the members
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> his family, and the saintly character attributed to Edmund may have
been partly owing to the austerities of a repentance, which prompted
his dying wish to be buried in chains.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<h3><i>Edgar</i>&emsp;&emsp;1097–1107.</h3>


<p>Hardly were the sons of Malcolm reinstated in their ancestral
dominions,—for the autumn must have been far advanced before the army
of the Atheling reached its destination,—when the western coasts of
Scotland were threatened with a repetition of the early invasions of
the Northmen.</p>

<p>From a very early period the whole of the islands along the western
coasts of Scotland were favourite resorts of the Scandinavian
Vikings, who established themselves amongst the scanty population of
the Hebrides with far greater ease than upon the mainland. From the
intermixture of the natives with the northern invaders, sprung the race
to which the Irish annalists, and occasionally the Sagas, give the name
of Gallgael, a horde of pirates plundering on their own account, and
under their own leaders, when they were not following the banner of any
of the greater sea-kings, whose fleets were powerful enough to sweep
the western seas, and exact tribute from the lesser island chieftains.
Man was from an early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> period the seat of the sovereignty of the Isles,
which was long centred in the family of the Hy Ivar, lords of Dublin,
and often kings or Jarls of Danish Northumbria. In the middle of the
tenth century the Islands fell under the dominion of Eric Blodæxe,
whose rivalry with Olave Sitricson weakened and divided the power of
the Anglo Northmen; and after the death of Eric they were ruled by
Magnus Haraldson and his family, the representatives of the elder
Sitric, who appear to have been driven from Limerick, the early seat of
that branch of the Hy Ivar. The exploits of this line of princes upon
the coasts of Wales are continually to be met with in the Welsh and
Irish chronicles of the period, but their title of Oirrigh is a proof
that they were not independent, and they probably paid tribute to the
head of their family at Dublin.</p>

<p>The united power of the Orkneys, the Islands, and the western coasts
of Scotland, in addition to the Irish Norsemen, failed to avert the
catastrophe of Clontarf, <span class="sni">A. D. 1014.</span> and the eleventh
century opened upon the decline of the Hy Ivar. The personal energy of
Thorfin, the great accession of territory resulting from his connection
with Malcolm the Second, and the union of all the northern islands with
his wide possessions on the mainland, enabled him to take advantage of
their weakness; and if the Sagas are correct, in attributing to him
a large <i>Riki</i> in Ireland, and in extending his dominion from
Thurso Skerrey to Dublin, the Jarl of the Orkneys may have assumed the
prerogatives of the earlier kings of Dublin, exacted tribute from their
dependants, and become the acknowledged leader of the Scottish and
Irish Northmen. During the ascendancy of Thorfin the Islands were for
some time under the rule of a certain Gille, and of Suibne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> MacKenneth,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1034.</span> names pointing to the Gaelic element amongst
the Gallgael; and it is not unlikely that they owed their rise to the
Jarl, and were amongst the earliest of the mainland chiefs of the
Oirir-Gael who disputed the possessions of the Hebrides with the kings
of Man.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Towards the middle of the eleventh century Dermot MacMalnembo, lord of
Hy Kinselagh and king of Leinster, was occupied in establishing the
supremacy of his family throughout his native province; and entering
the territory of the Dublin Norsemen, <span class="sni">A. D. 1052.</span> which was
known as Fingal, in the year 1052, he ravaged the country up to the
walls of their capital, driving out Eachmarcach, the son of Reginald,
then the head of the race of Olave Sitricson, and establishing
his dominion over the whole district and its inhabitants, whilst
Eachmarcach fled from his enemy to Man. <span class="sni">A. D. 1061.</span> Nine
years later, Murchad, the son of Dermot, following up the successes
of his father, pursued Eachmarcach to his island retreat, wrested the
sovereignty of the Islands from the race of Ivar, and rendered them
tributary to the line of Leinster. Thorfin, whose ascendancy appears
to have declined before this period, <span class="sni">A. D. 1064.</span> died soon
after the transfer of the Islands to Dermot; and his two sons, escaping
from the slaughter at Stamford Bridge, whither they had followed in
the train of the king of Norway, returned to their northern home,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1066.</span> and without dividing the possessions of their
warlike father, passed a peaceful and inglorious existence as joint
Jarls during the remaining thirty years of the century.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>Amongst the fugitives from Stamford Bridge was a son of Harald the
Black of Iceland, Godfrey, surnamed Crovan or “the White Hand,” who
found a hospitable reception in Man from another Godfrey who, at
the time of his arrival, was king, or Oirrigh, of the island.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
<span class="sni">A. D. 1072.</span> Six years after the arrival of the fugitive,
Dermot of Leinster fell in battle, after raising the power of his
province to the highest pitch, and uniting the supremacy over the
whole of southern Ireland, with the dominion of the Isles and of “the
Britons”—the inhabitants, apparently, of the Isle of Anglesey;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
and three years later, upon the death of Godfrey of Dublin, the son of
Eachmarcach and head of the race of Hy Ivar, Godfrey Crovan attempted
to seize upon the Islands.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1075.</span> Twice was
he defeated in his attacks upon Man; but refusing to be foiled, he
determined upon risking a final effort, and with a fleet collected
from the other islands, sailed up the river Selby by night, landed
his forces, and concealed a body of three hundred men amongst the
wooded sides of a neighbouring hill called Skeafell. As soon as it was
light, the Manxmen, perceiving the enemy whom they had already twice
defeated, assembled to give him battle, and attacked with headlong
confidence, heedless of the ambuscade, which fell upon them in the
heat of the engagement with decisive and fatal effect. They turned
and fled precipitately; but finding on arriving at the river that the
stream was unfordable, for the tide was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> then at its height, throwing
down their arms they begged for mercy from the conqueror; and as his
object was attained by their submission, he put an immediate stop
to the slaughter. His next step was to reward his confederates the
Islesmen, to whom he offered the choice of remaining and appropriating
the island, or of plundering it and returning to their homes; and as
the latter course was most congenial to his allies, the property of
the Manxmen was delivered over to their mercy. Many of the Islesmen,
however, consented subsequently to remain behind, and they were settled
by Godfrey in the south of the island, around his own immediate
residence, whilst the earlier Norse population was confined to the
north, a division which can long be traced in the little kingdom; and
the conqueror assuming to himself, as usual, the sole right of property
in his dominions, the Manxmen lost their Odal privileges in the same
manner as the Orkneymen had been deprived of theirs, from the time of
the first Einar, to the days of Sigurd Lodverson.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Godfrey Crovan was of a character to afford his new subjects frequent
opportunities of repairing the losses incurred through the pillage
of the Islesmen; and he soon extended his conquests over the Irish
Norsemen, capturing Dublin, <span class="sni">A. D. 1078.</span> and retaining his
supremacy for sixteen years, until he was driven out by Murketagh
O’Brien, whose family appear to have made more than one attempt
subsequently upon Man.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> His pre-eminence in the same quarter
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> also disputed by the surviving sons of Eachmarcach; but they
perished in a fruitless effort to vindicate their rights, <span class="sni">
A. D. 1087.</span> and from the date of this failure the descendants of
Ragnar Lodbroc never again rose above the rank of subordinate Oirrighs
of Dublin.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In the year after he was expelled from his Irish
conquests, Godfrey died of a pestilence in the Isle of Isla, <span class="sni">
A. D. 1095</span> leaving three sons to inherit his dominions. His great
power was based upon his fleet, and to prevent any rivalry upon the
seas he is said to have forbidden the Scots—the inhabitants apparently
of the western coasts and the Galwegians—to build any vessel requiring
more than “three bolts” in its construction.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition of the Islands when Magnus Olaveson sailed with
a powerful fleet from Norway, <span class="sni">A. D. 1098.</span> purposing to
re-enact the part of Harald Harfager, and establish the rights of the
Norwegian crown over the western conquests of his predecessor. First
touching at the Orkneys, he seized upon the two Jarls, and dispatching
them in safe custody to Norway, carried off their sons as hostages,
placing his own son Sigurd over the Jarldom; though, as the new Jarl
was a mere child, the real authority was vested in his council. The
king then steered for the Hebrides, rapine and slaughter marking his
course, and the flames of the crops and houses which he burnt lighting
up his onward career. Some of the Islesmen escaped to the mainland
of Scotland; others fled further and sought a refuge in Ireland—for
the Norwegian fleet was far too powerful to be resisted with any hope
of success by the scattered population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> of the islands—whilst the
least scrupulous, or the most insignificant, escaping with life by
submitting to Magnus, swelled the number of his followers, and repaired
their own losses by relentlessly pillaging their neighbours. Among the
unsuccessful fugitives was Godfrey’s eldest son Lagman, who, before he
could escape to Ireland, was surprised amongst the northern Hebrides,
and captured off Skye, after a vain attempt to baffle his pursuers
amongst the islands. In one feature alone was the expedition of Magnus
distinguished from the incursions of his heathen ancestors—the
sanctity of Iona was respected. The king is reported to have landed on
the sacred island, and opening the door of St. Columba’s Church, to
have hastily drawn back, forbidding any of his attendants to enter,
and departing immediately after granting peace and immunity to the
inhabitants. None ever knew whether a vision had appeared to the king,
but his clemency was limited to the hallowed island of Columba, nor was
the sword of the destroyer stayed in any other quarter.</p>

<p>At length Magnus arrived at Man, where the inhabitants were in no
condition to resist his attack, as they had already wasted their
strength in a sanguinary contest between the northern and southern
clans near Sandwith—Ottir and MacMaras, the rival leaders, both
falling in the course of the battle. At once recognising the importance
of the island for retaining his western conquests, he ordered the
immediate construction of several wooden forts, built in the usual
manner of the age; procuring timber for this purpose from the opposite
shores of Galloway, and forcing the Galwegians to convey supplies
to Man, and to join in labouring at the entrenchments. From Man he
crossed to Anglesey, ravaging the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> exacting tribute from the
people, and killing Hugh, Earl of Shrewsbury, who attempted to oppose
his descent; whilst he could now boast at the extreme limits of his
expedition of having extended his conquests further to the southward
than any of his predecessors upon the throne of Norway.</p>

<p>Magnus was occupied during the ensuing winter amongst the Sudreys, or
Southern Hebrides, in securing the conquests of the preceding summer
and in arranging a treaty with the Scottish king, who is said by some
authorities to have admitted the pretensions of the Norwegian monarch
to the whole of the islands in the western seas. To such an arrangement
(if it were ever made) Edgar could have offered no valid objection,
as the majority of the islands could hardly be said, at this time,
to have ever been included amongst the dependencies of the Scottish
crown. It is further stated that the king of Norway established his
claim to his new possessions by sailing round each of them separately;
and he is even said to have been dragged across the isthmus at Loch
Tarbert in a boat, with his hand upon the tiller, in order to include
Cantyre amongst the islands—a story probably invented at a later
period to account for the severance of that district from the mainland
possessions of the Oirir Gael, and its lengthened occupation by the
Gallgael in dependence on the Norsemen and their kings.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A.D. 1099</div>

<p>Magnus returned to Norway in the following summer, leaving Sigurd in
his new Iarldom; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> was occupied during the next three years in
warring against the Swedes, until peace was concluded, and cemented
by his marriage with a daughter of the Swedish king Inge. But his
former successes amongst the Hebrides had inflamed him with the desire
of further conquests in the same quarter, and hardly had he ratified
his alliance with Sweden before he again fitted out a fleet, to be
directed on this occasion against the Irish coasts. <span class="sni">A. D.
1102.</span> Murketagh O’Brien, collecting the men of Munster and Leth-Mogh,
prepared to oppose the invasion; but an arrangement was soon effected
between the kings, by which the daughter of Murketagh was given to
Sigurd Magnusson, whilst the claims of that prince upon the allegiance
of the Dublin Norsemen were probably supported by the Irish king.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1103.</div>

<p>Magnus passed the ensuing winter in Ireland, assisting his new allies
the Munstermen against their rivals, the northern Hy Nial, and
remaining until the following August, when he prepared to return to
Norway, and lay off the coast of Ulster awaiting a supply of cattle for
victualling his ships, promised by Murketagh O’Brien. The disastrous
defeat of the latter prince by the northern Hy Nial, early in the
same month, may have prevented or delayed the dispatch of the cattle;
and Magnus disembarked with a body of his men, both to ascertain
the fate of the scouts whom he had already sent out, and to victual
his fleet with the necessary supplies at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> expense of the men of
Uladh. Whilst thus employed he gradually became entangled amongst the
neighbouring morasses; and his retreat to the ships being intercepted
by the Ulstermen, who flocked in numbers towards the spot, he fell,
with many of his followers,—through the cowardice or treachery of
one of his principal officers,—in a fruitless attempt to open a path
through the increasing numbers of the foe. On hearing the tidings of
his death, the fleet, weighing anchor, sailed immediately for Norway,
touching at the Orkneys, and taking on board Sigurd, who relinquished
his Irish princess and his island kingdom to claim a share of his
father’s dominions, when all the conquests of Magnus reverted to their
original possessors; though the Jarls of the Orkneys, and the lords of
the Western Islands long continued, whenever it suited their purpose,
to rank themselves amongst the feudatories of the Norwegian crown.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of the expedition of Magnus Olaveson, the nine years
of Edgar’s reign seem to have been absolutely devoid of interest,
the total absence of event which distinguishes this period arising
probably from the personal character of the king. Of a gentle and
inoffensive nature, much resembling the Confessor, in his faults
perhaps as well as in his virtues, he provoked neither external
hostility from his ambition, nor internal revolt from his oppression;
whilst the marriage of his sister Matilda with the English Henry, must
have tended materially to strengthen his authority, by overawing the
turbulent spirits who otherwise might have presumed upon his indolent
disposition. He appears to have cultivated the alliance of the Irish
king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> Murketagh, who, from Edgar’s present of a camel, may have aimed
at resembling Henry of England in his partiality for rare animals.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
In imitation of the pious liberality of both his parents, he founded
the priory of Coldingham, granting it to the monks of Durham; thus
exhibiting his partiality for his mother’s country, and perhaps, also,
his attachment to her ancient confessor Turgot, the friend of his own
early youth, <span class="sni">A. D. 1107.</span> who at this time was prior of the
monastery of Durham.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Upon the 8th of January 1107, Edgar sunk into
an early grave, with his latest breath bequeathing the appanage of
Scottish Cumbria to his youngest brother David; not only as a testimony
of personal regard for his favourite brother, but as an acknowledgment
of the valuable assistance which he had derived, during his contest for
the crown, from the intelligence and sagacity of that able and politic

<h3><i>Alexander the First</i>&emsp;&emsp;1107–1124.</h3>

<p>Widely different in character from his peaceful and indolent
predecessor was the next king who filled the throne of Scotland.
To a purity of life, a fondness for the devotional exercises and
austerities of the age, and a reverential demeanour towards the
clergy—qualities which he inherited from his mother—Alexander united
the high courage and warlike bearing of his father; whilst his own
restless ambition and indomitable will involved him in continual
contests throughout his reign, and earned for him the appellation
of the Fierce. In many points he resembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> his sister the queen of
England; and the same lavish generosity towards strangers, with the
same somewhat ostentatious display of charity in feeding, clothing,
and washing the feet of the poor, to which “the Scottish Esther” (as
she is sometimes called) in vain endeavoured to incite her youthful
brother David, formed in Alexander a striking contrast to his haughty
and imperious bearing towards the great body of his subjects. Naturally
viewing with a jealous eye the dismemberment of his kingdom for the
advantage of his younger brother, he refused at first to carry out
the bequest of Edgar until David threatened to support his rights by
the sword; when the fear of the mail-clad auxiliaries, whom the long
residence and popularity of the Earl at his sister’s court would have
enabled him to call to his aid, at length extorted from Alexander a
tardy and reluctant recognition of his brother’s claims upon Scottish
Cumbria.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The effects of the new king’s determination to enforce submission to
his will, soon became apparent in a simultaneous rising of the ancient
enemies of his family, who must have recovered much of their former
power during the anarchy and confusion resulting upon the death of
Malcolm the Third. Donald Bane was perhaps indebted to the crown for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
their support, and his immediate successor was not of a disposition
to curb the increasing independence of his powerful and refractory
Mormaors; but Alexander, accustomed to the ideas of feudalism with
which he had become acquainted at the English court, was deterred by
no fear of consequences from exacting a very different species of
obedience from that which had satisfied the peaceful Edgar; and his
measures for controlling the disaffection of his subjects resulted,
before long, in a rebellion in the north.</p>

<p>The conspirators laid their plans with secrecy, and the men of Moray
and Mærne marched in haste to the south, in the hope of surprising
Alexander, and repeating the catastrophe of his brother Duncan. The
king was holding his court at Invergowrie—a residence to which he
always exhibited a marked partiality, as he had enjoyed the earldom of
the district from a very early period—when he received intelligence
of the near approach of his enemies, and with the prompt vigour of his
character, hesitated not an instant in confronting the danger, his bold
advance so daunting the conspirators that they turned and fled for the
mountains. Thither he followed without delay, so closely pressing the
pursuit that he swept through the northern earldoms without opposition,
until he reached the boundaries of Ross, where his opponents were
occupied in gathering their whole strength upon the opposite shores
of the Moray Firth. It was evidently their intention to dispute the
passage of the Firth, and to attack the army of the king whilst engaged
in crossing; but again anticipating their purpose, he reached the point
of passage, known as the Stockford, when it was high tide, plunged
at once into the stream, and crossing with his mounted followers in
safety, advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> upon the enemy before they could escape to mountain
or morass, and inflicted such a slaughter upon their surprised and
bewildered masses, that all disposition to revolt against his rule
was stifled in the blood of his opponents—his stern and sanguinary
vengeance upon this occasion earning for him the title of the Fierce.
The Monastery of Scone is supposed to have owed its erection to the
pious gratitude of Alexander for his speedy and triumphant success; and
in the foundation-charter of that ancient Abbey, the name of Heth, Earl
of Moray, stands prominently forward amongst the other Gaelic Mormaors,
who were assembled in dutiful attendance at the court of their lord the
Scottish king.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>This reign was destined to become the era of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> first collision
between the ecclesiastical and secular powers in Scotland. The last
known Gaelic or Culdee bishop of St. Andrews was Fothadh, who died in
the same year as Malcolm Ceanmore,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> the see remaining vacant during
the three succeeding reigns; but when Alexander ascended the throne,
he immediately determined upon appointing a bishop, who would be ready
to carry out the views upon religious subjects in which all the family
of Malcolm Ceanmore had been educated by their Anglo-Saxon mother.
Accordingly, in the first year of his reign he selected Turgot to fill
the vacant see of St. Andrews; but a difficulty, upon which he had
scarcely calculated, awaited him at the very outset of his undertaking.</p>

<p>Ever since the time when Bruno, Bishop of Toul, yielding (according
to the general opinion) to the advice of Hildebrand, Prior of Clugny,
relinquished the Papal insignia with which he had been invested by the
Emperor, and entered Italy in the garb of a pilgrim to abide by the
election of the Roman clergy, it had been the aim of the ambitious
churchman, whose master-mind is supposed to have directed the Papal
policy for a quarter of a century before he occupied the Pontifical
Chair, not only to emancipate the church from all dependence upon royal
authority, but to establish her dominion, as a temporal power, over the
whole extent of Christendom. The name of the Emperor disappeared from
Papal bulls; the titles of Apostolic Bishop and of Pope were declared
to belong to the occupant of St. Peter’s Chair alone;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> Archbishops
were appointed Metropolitans over other primates in spite of all
opposition; and Metropolitans were instituted without consulting their
clergy, solely by the force of Papal bulls;<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> measures calculated
to extinguish the remnants of independence in national churches, and
to place the whole Christian hierarchy at the disposal of the sole and
absolute will of the Pope. Whilst the clergy were thus to be reduced
to a dependent body, animated by the soul of one man, and carrying out
his vast schemes for temporal authority throughout the kingdoms of the
world, the secular power was attacked in more ways than one. The right
of granting kingdoms, and of releasing subjects from their allegiance,
was both claimed and exercised; Sicily was conferred upon the Norman
Guiscard; fealty was demanded from the conqueror of England;<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Spain
and Hungary were claimed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> Papal fiefs, and even the distant Russian
received his dukedom from the hands of the Bishop of Rome. It was then
also that the notorious Donation of Constantine first saw the light,
and the Papal claims to universal dominion were supported by apocryphal
documents, supposed to exist amongst the archives of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> But
the great struggle was about the right of Investiture, or of granting
the Ring and Pastoral staff to a newly made bishop, in token of his
appointment.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>From the period when Christianity became the recognised religion of
the Roman empire, the head of the state participated in the nomination
of bishops, who were supposed to be chosen by their flock, approved
of and consecrated by their fellow clergy, and confirmed in their
appointment by their temporal ruler. The voice of the people had long
been silenced, on account of the disgraceful tumults and outrages so
frequently occurring at the election of bishops, when instead of a
little band of devout believers purified by the test of persecution,
the flock was composed of the licentious rabble of a city. The voice of
the clergy was intended by the policy of Hildebrand to become a mere
echo of the Lateran; and the voice of the ruler of the state to be no
more heard except in liege acquiescence. The conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> of the princes
of that era afforded ample scope to Hildebrand for appearing in the
character of a reformer of the abuses of the age, for as the elections
of bishops by the popular voice had too often degenerated into scenes
of tumult and factious violence, so in the hands of princes they had
become but too frequently mere mercantile transactions. Bishoprics
and abbacies were either openly bestowed upon the highest bidder, or
were suffered to remain vacant for years that their revenues might be
appropriated to purposes of private emolument; and too many of the
superior clergy were very ready to profit by an abuse which opened an
easy access to the high places of the church, to those whose profligacy
would otherwise have barred their advance to preferment of which they
were utterly unworthy. Had the policy of Hildebrand been directed
simply to the correction of such abuses, and to the establishment or
restoration of a discipline which he deemed essential, its motives
would have been high and holy; but it is only too evident that
earthly ambition was the ruling principle of a mind elevated above
the meaner vices of the age, and that the reforms which he advocated
served as a cloak for promoting with unscrupulous energy that temporal
aggrandizement of the Papal See, which attained its culminating point
when Innocent the Third proclaimed himself “less than God, but more
than man, God’s Christ, and Pharoah’s God.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>With the influx of foreign clergy after the Conquest, the system
of Hildebrand penetrated into England, and its effects soon became
apparent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> nearly every bishop rushing into a contest with the
neighbouring prelates about the rights, privileges, or possessions of
his see. Canterbury claimed jurisdiction over all the British Isles
in virtue of the Bull of Gregory the Great to Augustine; and York
asserted ecclesiastical supremacy over Scotland on account of the
signature of Wilfrith at the council of Rome, and the short episcopate
of Trumwin over the Picts. When, therefore, Alexander requested the
Archbishop of York to consecrate Turgot, he was met by a claim to the
canonical obedience of the Scottish bishops, to which he was by no
means inclined to submit. The difficulty was set aside for the time
by Henry of England, who desired the Archbishop of York to perform
the necessary ceremonies, reserving the rights of both churches for
future discussion;<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> when Anselm of Canterbury wrote to forbid the
proceeding, as he had not yet consecrated Thomas of York, who had
hitherto evaded all profession of canonical obedience.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But this
second difficulty was shortly removed by the death of Anselm; and soon
afterwards, the Archbishop of York, and the Bishop of St. Andrews,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1109.</span> were both consecrated on the same day by the
Bishop of London.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Differences quickly arose between the king and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> Turgot, and though it
is impossible to state their nature with precision, they were probably
connected with the opposite views entertained by Alexander, and the
bishop, upon the necessity of immediately remodelling the state of
the Scottish church. At length the latter requested permission to
proceed to Rome for the purpose of laying his case before the Pope;
but Alexander steadily refused his sanction to a journey of which he
was far too sagacious not to foresee the consequences; <span class="sni">A.
D. 1115.</span> and Turgot only obtained license to retire to his former
residence in the monastery of Durham, where he fell ill and died in
1115.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Alexander determined that the next bishop should be chosen from the
province of Canterbury, in the hope of evading the claims of York
through the opposing pretensions of the rival see; but although he
wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury to this effect soon after the
death of Turgot, several years elapsed before he finally requested that
a monk of the name of Eadmer, <span class="sni">A. D. 1120.</span> who had been much
in the confidence of Anselm, should be sent to undertake the office
of Bishop of St. Andrews. Released from his allegiance to the English
king, and from his canonical obedience to the see of Canterbury, the
new bishop was duly installed in his diocese;<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> but Alexander soon
found that “he had gained nothing in seeking for a bishop out of
Canterbury,” for it would appear to have been the especial object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Eadmer to exalt the See of Canterbury by reducing the Bishop of St.
Andrews to the subordinate situation of a suffragan of the English
Metropolitan, in which he was steadily opposed by Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> who
showed the same determination in refusing permission to Eadmer to
retire to Canterbury in the capacity of Bishop of St. Andrews, as he
had previously evinced in opposing the departure of Turgot to Rome.
The English prelate was warned by the Bishop of Glasgow that he had
to deal with a prince of inflexible resolution, and that unless he
yielded the points in dispute, or relinquished the ring and crozier,
thereby surrendering up the bishopric, he would neither be able to live
in peace within the limits of the kingdom, nor would he be permitted
to cross its boundaries. Eadmer, at length giving way, resigned his
bishopric and retired to Canterbury; consoling himself with the thought
that the investiture of the ring, which he had received from Alexander,
had lost its spiritual efficacy by passing through the hands of a
layman.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1122.</div>

<p>Eighteen months of retirement and the advice of his friends, who
reminded him, with justice, that it was his duty to maintain the rights
and liberties of the church and kingdom in which he had accepted
the office of bishop, rather than to find suffragans for York, or
promote the claims of Canterbury,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> wrought an alteration in the
opinions of Eadmer; and he wrote submissively to Alexander, urging his
claims to be reinstated in the see of St. Andrews, and adding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> these
remarkable words, which at once place in view the real objects of the
dispute—“I entreat you not to believe that I wish to derogate in any
way from the liberty or dignity of the Scottish kingdom; since if you
still persist in retaining your opinion about your former demands in
respect of the King of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the
sacerdotal Benediction (an opinion with which I would not then concur,
from entertaining ideas which, I have since learnt, were erroneous),
you shall find that I will no longer differ from your views, nor will I
let these questions separate me from God’s service, and from your love,
that in all things I may follow out your will.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But it was now
too late; <span class="sni">A. D. 1123.</span> Alexander was inexorable; and at the
close of the following year he appointed Robert Prior of Scone to fill
the see, which he persisted in looking upon as vacant by the voluntary
resignation of Eadmer.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The contest thus maintained by Alexander against the pretensions of
the English Metropolitans extended to the diocese of Glasgow, in which
a bishopric had been re-established by Earl David shortly after the
death of Turgot. The earl had appointed his own tutor John to the see;
but the bishop-elect, terrified at his unruly flock, and shrinking
from the laborious, and perhaps dangerous, undertaking of introducing
amongst them the remodelled Roman discipline, fairly fled from the
country; though he was subsequently consecrated by Pope Paschal,
and sent back to his diocese, where he remained till the return of
Thorstein, Archbishop of York, to England.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> By a judicious line of
policy towards the Papal court, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> by the essential services which he
contrived to render to the cause of Henry in Normandy, Thorstein had
been enabled to triumph over the opposition of Canterbury, and he now
summoned the Bishop of Glasgow to acknowledge his canonical dependance
upon the see of York, <span class="sni">A. D. 1122.</span> suspending him from his
sacred office on his refusal.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> John appealed to Rome, but as the
archbishop was then in high favour, his cause does not appear to have
prospered, and he removed to Jerusalem, where he remained some months
with the Patriarch, occasionally exercising his episcopal functions
until he was recalled by the Pope and sent back to his diocese;
<span class="sni">A. D. 1123.</span> the dispute between the two churches remaining
undecided until many years afterwards, when Glasgow was liberated from
the claims of York, and declared to be in direct dependance upon the
see of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of his reign Alexander lost his queen Sibylla, a
natural daughter of the English king,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> of whom little is known, and—if
the account of a contemporary writer is to be trusted—that little is
not to her advantage, for her personal deficiencies were not redeemed
by the presence of moral virtues. She died suddenly at Loch Tay, in the
course of 1122, and within two years she was followed to the grave by
her husband, <span class="sni">A. D. 1124</span> who expired on the 25th of April
1124, whilst still in the vigour of manhood.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>It would be unreasonable to estimate the little that Alexander was
enabled to accomplish by the standard of his younger brother’s success
in following out a similar line of policy. Both brothers endeavoured
to assimilate their dominions to the feudal monarchies of the age,
and to introduce amongst their clergy the revised system of the Roman
Church; but the elder had greater difficulties to contend against,
with fewer advantages in his favour. The dismemberment of his kingdom
by the separation of Scottish Cumbria must have materially diminished
his power; and had not Alexander died without an heir, the impolitic
bequest of Edgar might have been fraught with most disastrous
consequences to Scotland. The principality of David must inevitably, in
course of time, have become dependant upon one of the greater kingdoms
by which it was surrounded; it could only have existed by skilfully
promoting disunion between its more powerful neighbours; and it is
more than probable that it would have eventually been annexed to the
greater kingdom, and been held by his descendants as a fief of the
English crown. The marked separation existing between the dominions of
the two brothers during the lifetime of the elder, is best ascertained
by a reference to the charters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> the period. The dignitaries at the
court of Alexander were exclusively, Gaelic Mormaors—Earls of Moray,
Fife, Atholl, and Strathearn, and other native magnates of similar
origin—the grandsons of the Northumbrian Cospatric, ancestor of the
Earls of March and Dunbar; Edward the Constable, the son of Siward
Beorn—in short, the nobility of ancient <i>Alban</i> and the Lothians;
whilst around Earl David gathered Moreville and Somerville, Lindsay and
Umphraville, Bruce and Fitz-Alan, Norman names destined to surround the
throne of his descendants, two of them to become royal, and all to shed
a lustre upon the feudal chivalry of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Alexander may have attempted to enforce, by resolute will, the changes
and alterations which were only carried out by David through an union
of consummate tact and policy; and it may have been to this part of
the king’s conduct that Ailred alludes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> when he describes him as
“endeavouring to compass things beyond his power;” for he was evidently
of a disposition to frame his policy, rather according to the dictates
of his own will, than to his ability to carry it out. He achieved
enough, however, to entitle him to be remembered as the first king
who essayed to place Scotland on a footing with the feudal states of
Western Europe; for Edgar left his kingdom much as he found it—his
very bequest of Cumbria, as an absolute property, was totally at
variance with the policy of either Saxon or Norman—and the innovations
of Margaret were confined to the court and the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The laws
and customs of the Gaelic people remained undisturbed in her days, and
her ideas of ecclesiastical reform were widely different from those of
Hildebrand, of whose system the church of her native country, at the
time she quitted it, was ignorant.</p>

<p>But the grant of the <i>Cursus Apri</i> made by Alexander to St.
Andrews—a grant which must be regarded, not so much in the light
of an original donation, as of a restoration to the church of
the lands which had been alienated to the royal family in their
capacity of <i>Cowarbs</i>, or hereditary abbots of the old monastic
establishment—was, unquestionably, the earliest step towards
remodelling the Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> church, though the king’s intentions were
frustrated by his dissensions with Turgot and Eadmer, and he died
before the consecration of Robert, Prior of Scone, the last bishop whom
he appointed. He was the first king also to introduce beyond the Forth
the custom of confirming grants by charter, in place of the outward
forms and ceremonies by which, in an earlier state of society, such
gifts were invariably accompanied; though upon the occasion of his
restitution of the <i>Cursus Apri</i> all the ancient formalities were
observed. The great feudal office of Constable is also first traceable
in this reign, and to the same king may be attributed the earliest
introduction of the sheriffdom—for the <i>Vicecomes</i> is to be met
with in some of his charters. Alexander may therefore be said to have
laid the first stone of the social edifice which David raised from the
foundation; though many a year was fated to elapse, and more than one
generation was destined to pass away, before the system inaugurated by
the sons of Malcolm Ceanmore, was effectually established throughout
the whole extent of their dominions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<h3><i>David the First</i>&emsp;&emsp;1124–1153.</h3>


<p>The death of Alexander, without heirs, reunited to the Scottish
kingdom the appanage of Cumbria, which had been so unwisely severed
from it by Edgar; and the last surviving son of Malcolm and Margaret,
the rightful heir by ancient Gaelic custom as well as by feudal law,
ascended the throne without dispute. An intimate connection with the
Court of England for upwards of a quarter of a century, had effectually
“rubbed off the Scottish rust” from David,—to use the words of the
contemporary Malmesbury,—converting him into a feudal baron; and many
years before he was called upon to fill the throne, he had gathered
around him in his Cumbrian principality a body of knights and barons,
from whom sprung the older Norman chivalry of Scotland. During his
residence in the south he married Matilda, the widow of Simon de St.
Liz and heiress of Earl Waltheof of Northumberland, a portion of
whose vast estates had been conferred upon each of her husbands in
succession—St. Liz having been created Earl of Northampton, whilst
the Honour of Huntingdon was granted to the Scottish prince; but the
great earldom of Northumberland was retained in the Crown, for after
the forfeiture of Robert de Mowbray, the English kings were jealous of
intrusting that important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> province out of their own hands.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The
sole offspring of the second marriage of Matilda was an only son, to
whom his parents gave the name of Henry, born about ten years before
the accession of his father to the throne of Scotland.</p>

<p>David was the first of his family who united the character of an
English baron to that of a Scottish king; and in the former capacity he
was soon called upon to exercise the political sagacity through which
he had reaped the reward of the appanage of Cumbria, which he held
during the lifetime of his brother Alexander. Upon the death of Henry
the Fifth of Germany, the English king, despairing of any male heir
from his second marriage, determined upon adopting as his successor
his daughter Alicia, who fifteen years before had been betrothed,
whilst a mere child, to the deceased Emperor. The princess, it is said,
was reluctant to leave a country in which she had resided since her
infancy, and where she still enjoyed vast possessions with the title
of Empress; but she had become a necessary instrument for furthering
the views of her father, and he turned a deaf ear to the entreaties
of the princes of Lombardy and Lorraine, whose desire to retain their
Empress interfered with the tenor of his policy. The assistance of the
Scottish king was early sought to join in securing the succession to
his sister’s child, and he passed a whole year in England in concerting
measures for this purpose. In the great council of London, to which
every baron of note was summoned, David was the first to swear fealty
to his niece,—who now, like her mother, had assumed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> popular name
of Matilda—as heiress of the kingdom in which he held the Honour
of Huntingdon; and it was by his advice that the unfortunate Robert
Curtois was removed from the custody of the bishop of Salisbury,
and placed in Bristol Castle under the safer charge of the Earl of
Gloucester: <span class="sni">A. D. 1226.</span> for the fears of Henry were at this
time directed against Robert and his son William, nor did he harbour
any suspicion of his frank and jovial nephew, Stephen of Boulogne, upon
whom he had heaped honours and dignities in return for his gallant
services in war.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The feudal obligations of his English fief, and his anxiety to promote
the interests of the future queen, led to the frequent and prolonged
absence of David from his own kingdom at this period of his reign,
offering many favourable opportunities for the inveterate enemies of
his family to enter once more upon a struggle for the superiority.
Heth the contemporary, and possibly the opponent of Alexander, was
no longer living, but his hereditary animosity survived in his sons
Angus and Malcolm, who availed themselves of one occasion when David
was detained in England, <span class="sni">A. D. 1130.</span> about six years after
his accession, to rise in arms and assert those claims upon the crown
of Scotland which they inherited through their mother, the daughter
of Lulach.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> In the absence of the king, the leader of the royal
forces was the Constable, and the safety of the kingdom now depended
upon Edward, the first historical personage upon whom the dignity
is known to have been conferred, and the son of that Siward Beorn
who accompanied the Atheling into Scotland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> Edward in this crisis
proved himself to be worthy of the trust, and meeting the Moraymen at
the entrance of one of the passes into the Lowlands of Forfarshire,
overthrew them with a loss of four thousand men at Stickathrow, not far
from the northern Esk—Angus the Earl, or as the Irish annalists call
him, the king of Moray, being left amongst the dead, though Malcolm the
other brother, escaping from the field, prolonged the struggle amidst
the recesses of the remoter Highlands, and the contest was not brought
to a conclusion until four years later.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1134.</span>
The prestige of the Moray Mormaors was still very great throughout
the northern and north-western Highlands, and as many of the national
party, even though partisans of the reigning family, viewed with
jealousy the increasing influence of “foreigners,” and the introduction
of laws and customs against which they entertained a rooted antipathy,
as long as a descendant of Kenneth Mac Duff remained at large, claiming
to be the representative of one of their ancient line of kings, his
standard became a dangerous rallying point both for open enemies and
disaffected friends. David, seriously alarmed, besought the assistance
of the barons of Yorkshire and Northumberland, who answering to his
call with alacrity, the flower of the northern counties speedily
assembled at Carlisle under the banner of Walter Espec. The numbers
and equipment of these Anglo-Norman auxiliaries, with the rumour of a
vast fleet with which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> Scottish king intended to prosecute the war
to extremity amongst the island fastnesses of the western chieftains,
filled the supporters of Malcolm with such dismay, that, in the hope
of atoning for their disaffection towards the king by treachery to
his unfortunate rival, Mac Heth was surprised by a body of his own
partisans, and delivered into the hands of David. He was at once
dispatched as a prisoner to the castle of Roxburgh, and David, in the
full determination of eradicating every trace of his enemies from the
district in which they had so long ruled supreme, declared the whole
earldom of Moray forfeited to the Crown, regranting great portions
of it to knights of foreign extraction, or to native Scots upon
whose fidelity he could depend. The confiscation of their hereditary
patrimony struck a death blow at the power of the great Moray family,
and more than one Scottish name of note dates its first rise from the
ruin of the senior branch of that ancient and far descended race.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Four more years had barely passed away before David was destined to
meet, in hostile array, the very men upon whose assistance he had
relied against his formidable adversary Malcolm Mac Heth. Upon the 1st
of December 1135, died Henry the First of England, <span class="sni">A. D.
1135.</span> bequeathing with his latest breath the whole of his dominions
to his daughter the Empress Queen. His spirit had hardly passed away
before Stephen, arriving suddenly in England, gained over to his cause
Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> favoured and confidential friend
of Henry, and William du Pont de l’Arche, who was joint keeper, with
the Bishop, of the immense wealth accumulated in the coffers of the
late king; and as the possession of the royal treasure in those days
was the surest means of opening a path to the throne, before the year
was ended Stephen was crowned king of England without opposition. The
Earl of Gloucester, whose unsuccessful contest for precedency with the
new king, when they both swore fealty to Matilda, had strengthened his
devotion to the cause of the latter, was still in Normandy with his
sister; but of all the other barons and prelates who pledged their
faith to support the Empress Queen in her claim upon her father’s
throne, none proved mindful of his oath save her uncle the king of
Scotland.</p>

<p>No sooner had intelligence of the death of Henry reached Scotland, than
aware of the necessity for promptitude, David led an army across the
frontier, and at the very moment of Stephen’s coronation in London,
the Scottish king was receiving the allegiance of the northern barons
in behalf of his royal niece. Carlisle and Norham, Werk, Alnwick, and
Newcastle, in short all the border fortresses beyond the Tyne, with
the exception of Bamborough, opened their gates at his appearance,
and he had advanced far into the territory of St. Cuthbert, upon his
route to Durham, when he was anticipated by the approach of a numerous
army under Stephen. <span class="sni">A.D. 1136.</span> No time could have been
lost by that prince in collecting his forces, as upon the 5th of
February, little more than six weeks after his coronation, he marched
into Durham. David retired upon Newcastle, and the two kings remained
in a hostile attitude for another fortnight before a conference was
arranged, at which conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> of peace were finally agreed upon. The
Scottish king, still true to his oath, refused to hold any fiefs of
Stephen; but Carlisle and Doncaster were conferred upon his son Henry,
in addition to the Honour of Huntingdon, with a promise that the claims
of the prince upon Northumberland, in right of his maternal ancestry,
should be taken into consideration if the English king ever regranted
that earldom. Peace was concluded upon these terms; all the castles
surrendered to David were restored with the exception of Carlisle;
and Henry, after performing homage at York for his English fiefs,
accompanied Stephen upon his return to the south.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Advancing years, and a disposition naturally pliant and easy, are the
reasons assigned by a contemporary historian for the acquiescence of
David in the usurpation of Stephen; but however willing he might have
been to support the cause of his niece Matilda, he must naturally have
shrunk from sustaining the whole weight of a contest, in which he
alone was in arms in her behalf. Nor must it be forgotten, that the
wife of Stephen was equally a daughter of one of David’s sisters; and
however the approach of age may have increased his aversion to war,
it had hardly yet diminished his characteristic sagacity, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> he was
undoubtedly a gainer by the conditions of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The event, as it proved, frustrated the intentions of both parties.
Stephen, when he held his court in London at Easter, assigned the
place of honour, upon his right hand, to his guest the Scottish
prince; an arrangement which so excited the jealousy of some of the
English barons, more especially of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
of Ranulf Earl of Chester—the latter of whom had claims upon Carlisle
and Cumberland—that, after openly expressing their discontent in the
presence of Henry, they left the court in a body. Incensed at this
unprovoked insult to his son, David recalled him from England; and
though Henry was repeatedly summoned by Stephen to perform his feudal
obligations, he was not permitted by his father to return to the
south.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1137.</div>

<p>The absence of Stephen in Normandy, in the following year, afforded
David a favourable opportunity of avenging the indignity offered to his
son, and of forwarding, at the same time, the interests of his niece
Matilda. Already an army was collected to cross the Borders, and the
barons of the north of England were assembled at Newcastle to repel
the invasion, when Thorstein, the aged archbishop of York, by his
intercession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> with both parties, obtained a promise from the Scottish
king to abstain from hostilities until Advent, by which time it was
expected that Stephen would have returned from the Continent. Shortly
before Christmas, therefore, a Scottish embassy arrived at the English
court, charged to declare the truce at an end unless Prince Henry was
placed in immediate possession of Northumberland; and as this abrupt
demand for the earldom was all but tantamount to a declaration of war,
Stephen, who had just concluded a peace for two years with Geoffrey
of Anjou, and was consequently in a position to concentrate all his
energies upon establishing his power at home, at once declined to
listen to the proposal; and his refusal to comply with the conditions
of David led to an immediate rupture with Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1138.</div>

<p>Upon the 10th of January 1138 the advance guard of the Scottish army,
under the command of William Fitz-Duncan the king’s nephew, crossed the
Borders, and attempted to surprise Werk Castle before daylight; but,
failing in their object, they wasted the surrounding country until the
arrival of the main body under David and his son Henry, when a regular
siege was commenced with all the engineering appliances of the age.
The castle was the property of Walter Espec, and so gallantly was it
defended by his nephew, Jordan de Bussy, that, before long, the king,
converting the siege into a blockade, marched with the remainder of
his army to effect a junction with William Fitz-Duncan, whom he had
already dispatched to lay waste the remainder of Northumberland; and
once more the northern counties endured a repetition of the scenes
of horror enacted, nearly seventy years before, in the early days
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> Conqueror. David, who had been long preparing for war, had
gathered his army from every quarter of his dominions; and around
the royal standard, the ancient Dragon of Wessex, might be seen the
representatives of nearly every race contributing to form the varied
ancestry of the modern Scottish people. The Norman knight and the Low
Country “Reiter,” the sturdy Angle and the fiery Scot, marched side
by side with the men of Northumberland and Cumberland, of Lothian and
of Teviotdale; whilst the mixed population of the distant islands,
Norwegians from the Orkneys, and the wild Picts of Galloway, flocked
in crowds to the banner of their king, to revel in the plunder of the
south.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The Galwegians, an unruly host of tributary allies rather
than of subjects, claimed to march in the van, and a piteous account
of their ravages, and enormities, has been left on record by the
contemporary chroniclers of Hexham. It was only by a great exertion of
authority, that William Fitz-Duncan was enabled to save that priory
from the destruction with which it was menaced by a body of exasperated
clansmen, whose chieftain had fallen in an affray with some retainers
of the monastery; and to prevent the possibility of such a sacrilege,
David quartered a body of Scots within its walls, whilst he granted
to the community his own share of the plunder, in reparation for the
injuries they had sustained from his undisciplined and semi-barbarous
followers.</p>

<p>The approach of Stephen’s army, early in February, warned the Scottish
leaders that it was time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> collect their scattered forces either for
battle or retreat; but David, who was in secret correspondence with
many of Stephen’s barons, entertained the hope of finishing the war
by a stratagem, without the hazard of a contest. All of the wretched
country-people who had escaped the slaughter—and they were principally
women—were either bartered for cattle on the spot, or driven northward
with the prospect of a hopeless captivity; whilst the main body of
the Scottish army withdrew to a small morass in the neighbourhood of
Roxburgh, inaccessible except to the few who possessed an intimate
knowledge of the locality. The burghers of the town were instructed to
throw open their gates, and admit the English army without resistance;
as it was David’s intention to enter with his followers in the dead
of night, and surprise Stephen in his fancied security, calculating,
that by the capture of the English king and his principal adherents,
the war would be brought to a successful conclusion; the accession of
the empress secured; and his own claims upon Northumberland readily
acknowledged by his grateful niece.</p>

<p>But though in the multitude of counsellors there may be wisdom, in the
multitude of confidants there is little chance of secrecy; and through
some unknown channel Stephen became aware of his enemy’s intentions.
Avoiding Roxburgh, he retaliated upon other Scottish districts the
injuries which had been inflicted on the north of England; but as
he began to entertain suspicions of the fidelity of certain barons,
and his army was weakened, as well by the want of provisions as by
the religious scruples—either real or pretended—of several of his
followers who objected to bearing arms in Lent, he soon retraced his
steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> towards the south, first possessing himself of Bamborough on his
passage through Northumberland, and placing in it a garrison on which
he could depend. The castle belonged to Eustace Fitz-John, a powerful
baron, of whose fidelity the king was so mistrustful, that, contrary
to all feudal precedent, he caused his person to be seized whilst in
actual attendance at court upon a summons of military service; and
Eustace was not restored to liberty until he yielded up to Stephen
the key-stone of his power in the north, long famous as the ancient
residence of the royal race of Ida, and the strongest fortress in
Northumberland.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion of the Easter festival set at liberty the scrupulous
chivalry of the age, to enter with renewed zest upon the pursuits of
war; and David was fast approaching Durham, when a mutiny amongst
the unruly Galwegians threatened both the life of the king, and the
safety of his army. A report, judiciously fabricated for the occasion,
that the enemy was approaching, restored order for the moment; the
mutineers flew to arms to repel the foe, and David at once leading
them to Norham, employed them, with the rest of his army, in besieging
the castle. The garrison surrendered after a short resistance, and it
affords a curious instance of the impregnability of the fortresses of
that age against the limited means of offence available to besieging
armies, that it was accounted a disgraceful occurrence when nine
men-at-arms, all of whom were inexperienced, and the majority suffering
from wounds, hopeless of relief from their lord the Bishop of Durham,
yielded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> a well victualled castle to the whole force of Scotland! An
offer was made to restore Norham to the bishop, if he would consent to
hold it as a fief from the Scottish king; but as the proposed terms
were declined, it was immediately reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The success at Norham was counterbalanced by a sally from Werk, in
which the indefatigable castellan of that fortress overthrew a body of
knights and men-at-arms, capturing several of the party, whom he put
to ransom, and carrying off a convoy of provisions intended for the
army of the Scots, which by this daring feat he once more drew around
his walls. Again the siege of Werk was converted into a blockade when
David marched to join the force, collected by the exasperated Eustace
Fitz-John, in an attempt to recover Bamborough; but though the burghers
of that place were driven, with considerable loss, from an outwork
in front of the castle, no permanent impression was made upon the
fortress itself, and it was useless to attempt a blockade without the
assistance, and co-operation, of a fleet.</p>

<p>Whilst the king was engaged before the castles of Norham and Werk,
the intractable division under William Fitz-Duncan, of little use in
a regular siege, had been dispatched to the more congenial occupation
of harrying Craven, and the adjoining districts of the shires of York
and Lancaster. The inhabitants assembled to resist the invaders, and
upon the 10th of June took post in four divisions at Clitheroe on the
Ribble; but their courage failing at the sight of the enemy, they broke
and fled at the first onset. As this was the first occasion upon which
the hostile parties had met in arms in the open field, the result
increased the audacity of the victors, who, spreading over the face
of the country, plundered and wasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> it on every side, surpassing if
possible their former excesses; but laying the foundation of future
retribution in the very extent to which they carried their ravages.</p>

<p>Hitherto the barons of Yorkshire had looked upon the distant warfare
with lukewarm indifference, each mistrusting his neighbour, and hardly
knowing whether to oppose the Scots, as became the trusty partizans
of King Stephen, or to support them as loyal subjects of the Empress
Queen, whose standard was already raised by Robert of Gloucester, and
her other friends, in the south and west. But when the war was now fast
approaching their own neighbourhood, when their own lands were about
to be plundered and their own vassals to be put to the sword, it was
time to shake off their apathy, and out of the very excesses of the
foe arose their strongest bond of union. Archbishop Thorstein preached
a holy war; and through every parish, priests bore the relics of the
saints, with all the imposing paraphernalia of the Roman Catholic
religion, proclaiming it to be the duty of every Christian man to
rise in defence of the church against barbarians, hateful alike to
God and man. Ilbert de Lacy and Robert de Bruce, the youthful William
Albemarle and the aged Walter de Ghent, summoned their followers to
meet at Thirsk; and even Robert de Mowbray, then a mere child, appeared
in armour at the head of his vassals to animate the courage of the
numerous retainers of his house. To the same place of meeting hurried
William Percy and William Fossard, Richard de Courcy and Robert d’
Estoteville; the knights of Nottinghamshire under William Peveril, and
the chivalry of Derbyshire under Robert Ferrers: whilst Stephen, too
much occupied to leave the south of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> England, dispatched a chosen body
of knights, under Bernard de Balliol, to join the flower of the midland
and northern chivalry in repelling the inroads of the Scottish foe.
Walter Espec, a baron of vast possessions, whose age and experience,
united to a gigantic stature and a ready eloquence, marked him out as
a leader fit to inspire confidence and exact obedience, reminded the
confederate nobles of the glories of their ancestry, and pointed out
to their retainers that the enemy was little better than an unarmed
mob.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Ralph, the titular bishop of the Orkneys, was commissioned,
in the place of the aged and infirm Thorstein, to grant a general
absolution to the army, which, strengthened by the consolations of the
ministers of religion, and encouraged by the exhortations of military
experience, viewed the impending contest in the light of a holy war,
and prepared with alacrity for battle.</p>

<p>After waiting in the neighbourhood of Bamborough until the arrival of
some expected reinforcements from Carlisle, Cumberland, and Galloway,
David moved southward to effect a junction with William Fitz-Duncan.
Their forces, when united, amounted to twenty-six thousand men,
and as most of the historians of the period represent this army as
“innumerable,” it affords some clue for estimating what was in those
days looked upon as a countless host. David was well aware of the
character of the army against which he was advancing, and with the
concurrence of his most experienced officers, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> determined upon
opposing his own knights and men-at-arms to the mailed chivalry of
England; rightly calculating, that, if he once broke through the rival
phalanx, his light armed irregulars, of little real use in the first
onset, would easily complete the victory. But the native warriors of
Alban, elated with the victory at Clitheroe, and vainly imagining
that the flower of England’s knights and men-at-arms would fly before
their impetuous charge, like the undisciplined peasantry and townsmen
of the district, loudly exclaimed against such tactics. “Of what use
were their breastplates and their helmets at Clitheroe?” exclaimed
the Scots. “Why trust you to these Normans?” added Malise Earl of
Strathearn, when David still remained unmoved; “unprotected as I am,
none shall be more forward in the fight.” “A great boast,” retorted
Alan Percy, “which for your life you cannot make good.” Alarmed at the
probable consequences of dissension at such a moment, David reluctantly
yielded the point in dispute, and the post of honour in the approaching
conflict was assigned to the men of Galloway.</p>

<p>One course yet held out a fair hope of success—a surprise—and David
determined to make the attempt.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> He ranged his army in four
divisions, the Galwegians marching in the van, with all who claimed
to share with them the honour of the first attack. The contingent
from Cumberland and Teviotdale composed the second division, with
the knights, archers, and men-at-arms under Prince Henry and Eustace
Fitz-John, by whom the battle ought to have been commenced. Then
followed the men of the Lothians, Lennox<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and the Isles; whilst the
king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> in person brought up the rear with the Scots and Moraymen, and
his own body-guard of English and Norman knights.</p>

<p>The morning of Monday the 22d of August favoured the design of the
Scots. A dense fog hung over the country, and under cover of the mist
the Scottish host rapidly advanced in unwonted order; for the commands
of David were rigorous in prohibiting his men from firing the villages
along their route, according to their usual practice. They had reached
the Tees, and were already crossing, when they were accidentally
discovered by an esquire, who galloped back to Thirsk, to warn the
confederate barons of the rapid approach of the hostile army.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
In the hope of yet averting the contest, perhaps also to gain time,
Robert de Bruce and Bernard de Balliol,—names singularly associated
as the emissaries of an English army to a Scottish king,—rode forward
to hazard a last appeal, pledging themselves, in the joint name of the
confederates, to obtain for Prince Henry the grant of Northumberland.
Bruce, in particular, warned the king of the danger he was about to
incur, in entering into a contest with the very men upon whose aid he
most relied, for curbing the refractory Galwegians, or for repressing
his own disaffected subjects; whilst, with tears in his eyes, he
besought him to be mindful of his ancient friendship, and by accepting
the conditions of peace, to put a stop to the frightful enormities of
his followers. The easy and kindly nature of David was fast yielding
to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> entreaties of Bruce, who had been his friend from childhood,
when William Fitz-Duncan, a man of high spirit and the chief promoter
of the war, angrily interposed, and reproaching the latter with a
breach of fealty to his lord, prevailed upon his uncle to break off
the conference; on which the two barons, formally renouncing their
allegiance to the Scottish king, turned their horses heads and rode
back to share the fortunes of the confederate army.</p>

<p>The delay was fatal to the attempted surprise; for it gave time to the
army of the barons to clear the town of Northallerton, and to take
up a favourable position, two miles further to the northward, upon
Cutton Moor. A ship’s mast, bearing upon its summit the consecrated
host, and surrounded by the banners of St. Peter of York, St. John of
Beverley, and St. Wilfred of Ripon, was elevated upon a waggon, and
marked the centre of the army, around which were grouped dismounted
knights and men-at-arms; whilst from the immediate neighbourhood of the
sacred standard, Bishop Ralph and his priests dispensed blessings, and
absolution, throughout the host. The front of the position was covered
by a line of archers, with a body of men-at-arms in support; all the
horses were then removed to the rear under the charge of a mounted
guard; and the remainder of the English forces—townsmen, apparently,
and the array of the county—were ranged around the real strength of
the army in the centre.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Levelling their spears, long the national weapon of the Scottish
infantry, and with wild cries of Albanach! Albanach! the ancient
<i>slogan</i> of the warriors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> of the north, the first division of the
assailants rushed to the charge; and such was the impetuosity of their
onset, that the front ranks of the English reeled beneath the shock,
and were borne back in confusion upon the dismounted knights around the
standard. But then came to pass all that David had anticipated, and the
unprotected lines of Scottish spearmen recoiled, and were dashed back
like breakers from off a reef, before the steady discipline of that
animated wall of iron. Broken, but not discouraged, they cast aside
their fractured and useless lances, and, with drawn swords, once more
flung themselves, with reckless valour, upon the foe: but the front
ranks of the English had now rallied, and, from behind their dismounted
comrades, the archers poured in a storm of arrows, those fatal Norman
weapons which won so many a field for England in the days of old.
Unsheltered from the shower of missiles by any defensive armour, rank
after rank of the assailants went down before the English bowmen,
the best and bravest of their leaders falling in fruitless efforts
to penetrate the fatal line; and already the attack was slackening,
when Prince Henry brought his mounted division into the battle, and
the Norman chivalry of Scotland, with the disciplined retainers of
Eustace Fitz-John, bore down with levelled lances to the charge. His
success was complete. That part of the English army which sustained
the shock, was ridden down and swept from the field; and the prince,
elated with his easy triumph, and imagining that the whole Scottish
army was pressing on in support, wheeled round in the rear of the
English position to complete a victory not yet achieved, and charging
the mounted guard left to protect the horses, broke and pursued them
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> many miles. His error was fatal; for the critical moment of the
day had arrived, and the English were rapidly giving way, none holding
their ground except the veteran phalanx in the centre, when suddenly
a gory head was raised aloft, and the voice of one who was never
subsequently recognized, loudly proclaimed that the king of Scotland
was slain. More than once has such a cry turned the fortune of the day
against a brave, but undisciplined, army. Upon the field of Assingdon
it won the realm of England for Canute; at Hastings it all but wrested
the same prize from the Norman William, though he led the flower of
Europe to the field; and it decided the day upon Cutton Moor in favour
of the confederate army. No longer pressed by the division of Prince
Henry, the English rallied at the cry; and the Galwegians, who for
two hours had prolonged their attack with desperate and unflinching
courage, until the last of their chieftains fell beneath an English
arrow, panic stricken at their loss, turned and fled the field; whilst
the confederates, promptly taking advantage of the confusion, advanced
at once to the charge. The Saxons of the Lothians broke at the first
onset; and though David, leaping from his horse, and placing himself at
the head of the reserve, bravely endeavoured to stem the advance of the
enemy, the Scots wavered and were carried away in the rout; whilst the
king, maddened at the thought of defeat, refused to fly until he was
forced off the field by his own body-guard. High above his head still
fluttered the ancient Dragon of Wessex, contradicting the report of
his death, and numbers who had been swept away in the first confusion
of the flight, disengaging themselves from the crowd of fugitives,
and rallying around the banner of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> king, presented a formidable
front to the advancing foe. The foremost of the pursuers were either
cut down or captured, and the rest soon gave up following the Scottish
army, which, without further molestation, retreated in perfect order to
Carlisle.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The losses of the Scots upon this memorable occasion were estimated at
ten thousand men, a number probably exaggerated, together with all the
plunder they had accumulated, the place where it was captured being
long remembered as Baggage Moor. More perished in the flight than in
the battle—and such was generally the case—for not only were the
fugitives massacred by the exasperated peasantry, but whenever they
came into contact with each other, Angles, Scots, and Picts of Galloway
fought with all the animosity of mutual hatred. The victors, deprived
of their horses by Prince Henry’s charge, could make no attempt at
following up their success: so, separating with mutual congratulations,
they dispatched intelligence of their victory to Stephen, who, in
acknowledgment of their important services, raised two of their
number to the dignity of earls; Robert Ferrers obtaining the Earldom
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> Derbyshire, whilst that of Yorkshire was conferred upon William
Albemarle.</p>

<p>The battle of Northallerton, long famous under the name of the battle
of the Standard, adds but another to the many bitter proofs, that an
army without discipline is simply a disorderly mob. The discordant
elements of the Scottish nation were naturally averse to coalesce;
whilst the custom of “Scottish service,” which bound every man to
attend “the hosting across the frontier,”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> swelled the ranks of
the army with a body of men, fierce and warlike indeed, and endued
with that self-willed and reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> courage which has on more than
one occasion been their bane, but often indifferently armed, and as
undisciplined as they were unruly. David, brought up amongst the Norman
chivalry of the court of England, was well aware of the military
character both of his own followers and of his opponents, and framed
his plan of attack accordingly, the result of Prince Henry’s charge
fully justifying his original decision; and when the fear of a mutiny
at a most critical moment forced him to yield his better judgment, he
rightly determined upon the sole course left open—a surprise. But in
allowing Bruce and Balliol to gain time by parlying, thus confirming
the character ascribed to him by Malmesbury, he committed a serious
and fatal error, sacrificing every advantage he had already obtained,
and enabling the confederates to clear the town of Northallerton,
and receive the shock of his disorderly host in a favourable and
well-chosen position, that ensured victory to the defending army.</p>

<p>Upon the third day after the arrival of the Scottish army at Carlisle,
the anxiety of the king about his son was set at rest by the safe
arrival of the prince. Henry, upon his return from his second charge,
instead of meeting, as he had expected, with a victorious army, beheld
the royal standard slowly retiring in the distance, and at once
comprehending the catastrophe, arranged with his companions to mingle
with the pursuers and endeavour if possible to rejoin the king. In
order to prevent recognition, they agreed to disperse in different
directions, first divesting themselves of everything that could betray
their real character; so that out of two hundred knights originally in
attendance upon the prince, only nineteen entered Carlisle in armour.
Other fugitives reached the same place by degrees, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> the king busied
himself in restoring discipline, and in punishing with severity all
whom he deemed guilty of misconduct or defection. Heavy fines were
levied upon the delinquents, who were also bound by oaths and hostages
never again to desert the royal person in battle, and when order was in
some measure restored, David once more led his army to the investment
of Werk.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>He was still prosecuting the siege when he was informed of the approach
of the Papal legate Alberic Bishop of Ostia, and hastened to meet him
at Carlisle, with the clergy and nobility of his dominions. <span class="sni">
A. D. 1130.</span> Eight years previously, upon the death of Honorius the
Second, sixteen cardinals had declared for Innocent the Second, whilst
the majority elected Peter of Leon under the name of Anacletus,
who through the wealth of his father, a converted Jew, was enabled
successfully to establish himself in Rome. Two princes alone adhered to
the antipope, his own brother-in-law Roger Count of Sicily, who by this
course converted his coronet into a crown, and David of Scotland, the
reasons for whose conduct are not so easily apparent. Upon the death
of Anacletus, which occurred in the beginning of this year, an attempt
to continue the schism by electing another rival to Innocent, who took
the name of Victor the Fourth, was rendered abortive by the speedy
resignation of the ephemeral pope; Innocent returned without opposition
to Rome, and it was principally to notify the extinction of the schism,
that Alberic was dispatched as legate to the kings of England and
Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1138.</div>

<p>He arrived at Carlisle four days before Michaelmas, bringing with him
the Scottish chancellor William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> Comyn, whom he had ransomed from his
captors at Northallerton, and everything was satisfactorily arranged
during the three following days. Eardulf was admitted to the see of
Carlisle, and John was recalled to Glasgow from the monastery of
Tiron, in which that determined absentee had taken refuge from the
troublesome duties of his diocese;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> whilst reparation was made by
David, even before it was demanded, for the injuries sustained by the
Priory of Hexham from an unauthorised foray of a party of the Scottish
army,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and the wildest tribes promised to set their captives at
liberty, and to abstain henceforth from indiscriminate slaughter. Still
the benevolent Alberic was oppressed with anxiety, for during his
progress through the north he had been an eyewitness of the frightful
consequences of the ravages of the hostile armies. All Northumberland
was a desert, no attempt was made at cultivation, nor was an inhabitant
to be met with along the route which he had traversed. The barons
with their retainers were shut up in their castles, the peasantry and
their families crowded the monasteries, or lurked in the wildest and
most inaccessible retreats. The good bishop, dreading a recurrence of
such horrors, and feeling that his sacred office imposed more than
the mere formal duties of his legateship, besought the king to accept
of his mediation with Stephen, and thus to put an end to the miseries
of the war. Long was David inexorable, until the representative of
the haughtiest prelate of Christendom, kneeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> before the king of
Scotland as a humble suppliant for “peace upon earth,” prevailed so
far that a truce was arranged to last until St. Martin’s day, from
the benefit of which the garrison of Werk was alone to be excepted;
and Alberic, departing from Carlisle upon Michaelmas day, retraced
his steps towards the court of Stephen, in the true character of a
Christian bishop, as the bearer of a message of peace.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The castle of Werk still held out, though David, having ascertained
that its defenders were short of provisions, continued to press the
siege with unabated rigour. But Jordan de Bussy was indomitable. The
horses of the garrison yet survived, and he was determined that they
should be sacrificed one by one to enable their masters to continue
their stubborn resistance, proposing, when this last resource failed,
to make a desperate sally in the all but hopeless attempt to cut his
way through the besieging army. From this last alternative he was
saved, for when his stock of provisions was reduced to two horses, one
alive and the other <i>in salt</i>, the abbot of Rievaulx arrived,
with the commands of Walter Espec to surrender the castle; and David,
in a spirit of knightly courtesy that does him credit, provided this
gallant little garrison, twenty-four in number, with fresh horses,
and permitted them to depart with their arms, and all the honours of
war.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Much about the same time arrangements were concluded for the settlement
of a firm and lasting peace between the two kings. Alberic had not
been unmindful of his mission of peace, and, after the conclusion
of the council of London, he pressed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> Stephen the necessity
of putting a stop to the horrors of the northern war. At first the
English king showed as decided an aversion to conclude a peace as his
antagonist, and his exasperation was encouraged by a numerous party
amongst his barons, who burned to avenge themselves for their losses.
But Alberic soon found that he possessed an ally whose influence more
than counterbalanced that of the war party, in Matilda the queen of
Stephen, who was warmly attached to her uncle and cousin, and most
anxious to promote a friendly feeling between her Scottish kinsmen
and her husband. She joined her entreaties to those of the legate,
who, rightly appreciating the value of such support, hesitated not to
return to Rome long before the truce expired, in the full conviction
that his benevolent object was attained.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> <span class="sni"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
1139.</span> Nor were his anticipations destined to be falsified, and as
Stephen left the whole conduct of the negotiation in the hands of his
queen, in the following April she repaired to Durham for the purpose of
meeting her cousin Henry. Neither of the kings were present upon this
occasion,—indeed they never appear to have met,—but the conditions
of the peace had been already settled, and it had been decided that
Henry was to receive investiture of Northumberland in addition to his
other fiefs, the barons of the shire holding of the Scottish prince,
saving their fidelity to Stephen. The English king, however, continued
to retain Newcastle and Bamborough in his own possession, for which an
equivalent was to be provided in the south of England—Henry on his
side guaranteeing to preserve unaltered throughout his new fiefs, “the
laws and customs” of the late king Henry, and to respect the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> rights
of the Archbishop of York and of the Bishop of Durham. The barons of
Northumberland then swore fealty to their new Earl, who, delivering up
the sons of five of the principal nobles of Scotland as hostages for
the due performance of his part of the agreement, accompanied the queen
upon her return to the south, when the treaty was confirmed by Stephen
at Nottingham.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>During the whole of the following summer Henry remained in England,
sedulously courting popularity by his lavish munificence and gallant
bearing—qualities so acceptable to the Norman chivalry of the age. He
accompanied Stephen to the siege of Ludlow Castle, narrowly escaping
capture on this occasion; for, on approaching too closely to the walls,
he was unhorsed by a hook suddenly launched from the battlements, owing
his rescue solely to the prompt and daring gallantry of the king.
In the course of the same year he was united to Ada de Warenne, the
youngest daughter of the great earl of that name; and as the bride’s
family were staunch adherents of the cause of Stephen, and the Scottish
prince, bound by no ties to the empress, was probably far more attached
to the amiable character of Queen Matilda—whose influence seems
traceable in the marriage—than to her haughty and imperious cousin,
the arrival of the latter in England with the Earl of Gloucester,
appears to have produced no interruption of cordiality between Henry
and the English king. He was again present with his countess at the
English court in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> following year, <span class="sni">A. D. 1140.</span> in
spite of the civil war then raging, barely escaping, on his return to
Scotland, the machinations of his ancient enemy the Earl of Chester,
the grant of Carlisle being once more the cause of their quarrel.
Ranulph, tempted by the prevailing anarchy, had planned the seizure of
Henry and the Countess Ada, counting probably upon extorting, as their
ransom, a surrender of the coveted fief; but the queen, anticipating
his design, warned Stephen of the danger, who, in accordance with
her suggestions, escorted his guests in person to the north, thus
frustrating the intentions of Ranulph, but, by so doing, drawing upon
himself the hatred of that fickle and revengeful baron.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1141.</div>

<p>After the defeat and capture of Stephen at Lincoln, David, who had
hitherto refrained from espousing the cause of either candidate for
the throne of England, hastened to join the empress, leaving his
chancellor, William Comyn, at Durham, with instructions to hold that
important bishopric in her name. He arrived in time to accompany his
niece upon her entry into London, his presence confirming the fidelity
of many of the leading barons, but failing to inspire Matilda with any
portion of his own sagacity, and her arrogant and imperious behaviour
soon alienated the affections of her new subjects. Driven out of
London by the hostility of the citizens, her personal antipathy to the
imprisoned king next caused a rupture with his brother, the influential
Bishop of Winchester, who turned a willing ear to the entreaties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Stephen’s queen, now as eager in urging war in behalf of her captive
husband, as in advocating peace, a few years previously, with her
Scottish relatives. Participating in the ill success which he could
not avert, David was present at the rout of Winchester, only escaping
capture through the attachment and devotion of a youthful godson, David
Olifard, then serving in the hostile army, who, concealing him from all
pursuit, enabled him to return in safety to Scotland. The grateful king
was not unmindful of his friendly benefactor; and it was probably in
requital for his services upon this occasion that Olifard obtained a
grant of lands in Scotland, becoming the founder of a numerous family,
whose name is still well known in the country of his adoption.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>It has been already mentioned that in passing through Durham on his way
to the south, David left his chancellor, William Comyn, in that city,
in the hope that he might be elected to the vacant see, and hold the
bishopric in the interest of the empress queen. Nothing will convey a
clearer idea of the anarchy of the period, and of the extraordinary
measures that were occasionally resorted to by the gravest characters,
than a narrative of the proceedings of William Comyn. He had passed his
early years in the household of the late bishop Geoffrey, and, upon
the death of the latter, his relatives, wishing to favour the views of
Comyn, kept the catastrophe a profound secret, the body of the dead
bishop being submitted to an elaborate course of preparation, including
a process of <i>salting</i>, in order that it might be preserved above
ground until the arrival of the Scottish chancellor! One important
point remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> to be gained—the consent of the chapter—and this was
resolutely refused. Escaping from Durham, they chose William Dean of
York to be their bishop; but their troubles were only commencing, for
they had to deal with a most determined character in the chancellor. In
vain the Pope deprived him of the Archdeaconry of Worcester which he
had hitherto enjoyed, and launched an anathema at his head; in vain the
newly-chosen bishop endeavoured to enter his Episcopal city by force of
arms. Comyn set at nought the anger of the distant pope, and drove out
the monks who attempted to give secret admittance to his rival. Filling
their monastery with his own men-at-arms, he converted it into a
regular fortress—a not unusual course of proceeding in that turbulent
era—and, secretly supported by Prince Henry and the Earl of Richmond,
for three years he kept the bishop at bay, until the sudden death of
a favourite nephew induced him to make overtures for an arrangement,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1144.</span> and the bishop was at length permitted to enjoy
undisputed possession of his dignity. A grant of the honour of Allerton
was conferred upon another of the chancellor’s nephews, Richard Comyn,
the founder of that name in Scotland, whose union with Hextilda, the
heiress of Bethoc, sole daughter of Donald Bane, may have contributed
to the greatness of the family; and, by this arrangement, a scandal by
no means of uncommon occurrence amongst the churchmen of that age, was
at length compromised, and brought to a satisfactory conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p>Many years elapsed before the Scottish king was again induced to enter
upon the scene of English politics—internal rather than external
policy appearing to have occupied his attention during this period
of his reign, and many of the alterations he had previously set on
foot were now probably completed and confirmed. He had not lost
sight, however, of the interests of the empress and her son; and in
his anxiety to further the designs of the latter, <span class="sni">A. D.
1149.</span> about eight years after the siege of Winchester, upon the
crown of England, he was again brought to the verge of a rupture with
Stephen. The youthful Henry Fitz Empress suddenly arrived at Carlisle
to receive the honour of knighthood from the hands of his venerable
kinsman, Ranulph of Chester, who had purposely repaired to the same
city, with Henry of Scotland, assisting in the solemnities of the
occasion. Ceremonial and festivity, however, only served to cover
the real object of the meeting, and arrangements were set on foot,
at the same time, for cementing an alliance which was to place young
Henry upon the English throne. The Earl of Chester, consenting to
waive all claims upon Carlisle, performed homage to David on receiving
in exchange the fief of Lancaster, with a promise that a daughter
of Prince Henry should be given in marriage to his son. Henry Fitz
Empress bound himself, if ever he regained his grandfather’s throne, to
confirm, without let or hindrance, to David and his heirs, Newcastle
and Northumberland, from Tyne to Tweed, with all the other English
fiefs that belonged to the heir of the Scottish crown, in right of his
descent from Earl Waltheof; and, these preliminaries being adjusted,
it was agreed that the earl was to concentrate his followers upon
Lancaster; and that the Scottish army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> strengthened by his retainers
and by the barons of the western counties who adhered to Henry, should
at once advance against Stephen, who, suspecting the proceedings at
Carlisle, had already reached York on his march towards the north. In
accordance with this arrangement, David and his young relative lost no
time in reaching Lancaster; but Randolph, fickle and treacherous as
usual, was as faithless to his new allies as he had been ever false to
Stephen. He failed in his appointment at Lancaster, Henry recrossed the
sea to Normandy, and the two kings, mutually averse to the hazard of an
open rupture, led back their armies without a contest.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of David’s reign the peace of Scotland was disturbed
for a considerable time by the pretensions of a most extraordinary
imposter, who, by a singular chance, has been confounded by the
historians of the last five hundred years with the very person whose
son, or nephew, he seems to have attempted to personate. In the course
of 1134, the same year in which Malcolm MacHeth was committed to
Roxburgh castle, Olave Godredson, king of Man, granted certain lands
to Ivo, abbot of Furness, for the erection of a priory at Rushen; and
amongst the brotherhood who, either at that time or subsequently, were
sent into the Isle of Man, was a monk of the name of Wimund, a man of
obscure birth but of considerable talents, and still greater and most
unscrupulous ambition. His jovial countenance and ready eloquence,
his stalwart frame and commanding stature—for he towered a head and
shoulders above the height of ordinary men—marked him out as a fit
leader for an ignorant and excitable multitude, though scarcely in
the capacity of a bishop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> Yet the Manxmen thought otherwise, and, in
process of time, Wimund was advanced to the see of the Isles; though
such peaceful dignity suiting ill with his restless disposition,
he only regarded his appointment as a stepping stone to further
advancement, soon giving himself out as a son of the Earl of Moray,
and inviting the boldest and most reckless of his wild flock to assist
in avenging the injuries, and recovering the possessions, of his
supposed father, promising unlimited plunder to all who followed him to
Scotland. The descendants of the old sea-rovers flocked eagerly to the
call of their singular pastor, whose influence over them was unbounded,
and the warlike bishop lost no time in leading his followers to the
pillage of the western coasts. His proceedings, ere long, proved him to
be no mean proficient in the tactics of partizan warfare. The approach
of a hostile force was the signal for immediate departure, Wimund and
his followers dispersed amongst the islands, and upon the arrival of
the royal army the sole tidings of the enemy were the reports of his
excesses in another direction. No sooner had his pursuers retraced
their steps, than the bishop and his satellites were again on the
alert, carrying fire and sword throughout the district just evacuated;
and so often and so successfully were these tactics repeated, that
David is said to have experienced more trouble and anxiety on account
of this turbulent monk, than through any other enemy during the whole
course of his reign. Once, only, he sustained a check, which he
received from an appropriate quarter—another bishop, who refusing
to submit to his demand for tribute on the singular, but strictly
ecclesiastical, grounds that “one bishop should not pay tribute to
another,” summoned his own flock to resist the unorthodox intrusion,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> launched a light battle-axe at the head of Wimund with an aim so
accurate that the burly monk reeled beneath the blow, and his followers
fled from the field.</p>

<p>At length, in despair of succeeding by force, the king adopted an
opposite policy, and bought off the hostility of Wimund by a grant of
Furness in Westmoreland, where, for a short time, the bishop played the
tyrant with impunity, particularly directing his virulence against the
monastery in which he had passed his early days. At length the people
of the neighbourhood, whose patience was worn out by his exactions,
watching their opportunity, seized upon him at an unguarded moment,
and the luckless Wimund, to whom no mercy was shown, was deprived of
his see, and passed the remainder of his life, sightless and cruelly
maimed, in the monastery of Biland. No sufferings, however, could
subdue the reckless spirit of the man, who was wont to boast, with a
laugh, that “even Providence could only conquer him by the faith of a
foolish bishop;” adding, that if his enemies had only left him as much
sight as a “sparrow’s eye,” he would have soon shown them how little
cause they had for triumph.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>The whole of the north of England beyond the Tees had now for several
years been under the influence, if not under the direct authority,
of the Scottish king, and the comparative prosperity of this part
of the kingdom, contrasting strongly with the anarchy prevailing in
every other quarter, naturally inclined the population of the northern
counties to look with favour upon a continuance of the Scottish
connection. All southward of the Tyne, indeed, was held probably in
the name of the Empress Queen, but the influence of David extended
far beyond the Tees, and when a claim was raised upon the Honour of
Skipton in Craven, it was the Scottish, and not the English king who
decided upon its validity. William Fitz Duncan was the claimant, the
heir of Duncan the Second and the victor at Clitheroe, whose fiery
courage broke off the conference before the battle upon Cutton Moor,
and whose prominent position upon this and other occasions during the
war, seems to mark him as the Gaelic Toshach. Like his father, however,
he was more of a feudal than a Gaelic noble, and several years before
this date he married, during the lifetime of Archbishop Thorstein,
Alice de Rumeli, the heiress of her Norman name; three daughters and
one son, whose fame yet lingers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> local tradition as William of
Egremont, being the issue of their union. It was in right of his wife
that William raised his claim; <span class="sni">A. D. 1151.</span> and as it must
have suited well with the policy of David to increase the feudal ties
incidentally securing the fidelity of his nephew, he lost no time in
installing him in the Honour, willingly providing him with the means
of enforcing his rights (as some opposition appears to have been
meditated), and atoning for the depredations of the more unruly portion
of the army by the gift of a silver chalice wherever the property of
the church was shown to have suffered from their licence.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>One of the most important objects of David’s policy at length appeared
to be satisfactorily attained, and the great northern fiefs of his
wife’s father added securely to the Scottish crown. They were at
present held by his son, and in some sort as a guarantee of neutrality
towards Stephen, which, though slight was so far effectual that it
restrained David from ill-advised hostilities; whilst the feeble hold
of Stephen upon the fiefs in question must have rendered him unwilling,
as long as a nominal peace was preserved, to risk the chances of an
ineffectual forfeiture which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> he could have scarcely hoped to carry
out. In the event of the Duke of Normandy’s accession, there was the
solemn contract ratified at Carlisle, which was to confirm the Scottish
princes in the hereditary possession of these fiefs, in which it might
well be hoped that a kindred people in language, origin, and laws,
would amalgamate in course of time, under the fostering rule of the
representatives of the sainted Edward, with the Anglian inhabitants of
the Lothians. Even the population of that great Episcopal Palatinate,
where the bishop ruled with regal power and privileges over a district
scarcely yet included in Norman England at the time of the Domesday
survey, was in sympathy and in race far more akin to the Angles of
Bernicia than to the descendants of the Scandinavian conquerors of
the Danelage; and the tendency of the men of Durham to turn their
regards towards the North, was sedulously encouraged ever since the
days of Margaret. It was her husband, the Scottish Malcolm, who laid
the first stone of the new church in the Episcopal city; her sons and
their leading nobles who enriched with their donations her favourite
monastery; and now the last and greatest of her immediate family
sheltered the sacred territory of St. Cuthbert from the miseries of
southern England, and secured for it the advantages of peace. The grant
of the English fief of Furness to Wimund, by which a troublesome enemy
was converted into a questionable feudatory, and the confirmation
of Skipton, also a dependency of the English crown, to William Fitz
Duncan, were carried out by the Scottish king without the slightest
reference to the prerogatives of the English sovereign; and owing to
the distracted state of England during the reign of Stephen, never was
Scotland at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> period of her history more powerful relatively to her
southern neighbour, than during the last ten years of David’s reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1152. 12th June.</div>

<p>Bright as were the hopes of the aged king, when he established his
nephew in the inheritance of the de Rumelis, in the following summer
they were doomed to disappointment, when a sudden gloom was cast
over Scotland by the untimely death of Prince Henry. Nor was the
sorrow thus felt confined to his native land alone, for his loss was
regretted throughout the neighbouring kingdom. His death was indeed a
calamity for Scotland, for all the virtues of his family are said to
have centred in his character; and handsome in person, and gallant in
bearing, he possessed in addition those popular qualities which, had
he lived, would have endeared him to his people; though the elaborate
praises dictated by the attachment of his early friend, the abbot of
Rievaulx, are perhaps less emphatic than the brief description of
St. Bernard, “a brave and able soldier, he walked like his father in
the paths of justice and of truth.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> By his marriage with Ada de
Warenne, who survived him, Henry left six children, three sons and
three daughters. Of the former, Malcolm and William lived to ascend
the throne of Scotland, and David, the youngest, long enjoyed the
Honour and title of Huntingdon. Ada, the eldest daughter, became the
wife of Florence Count of Holland, carrying with her as a dowry the
northern earldom of Ross. Margaret, the second, was twice married;
first to Conan Duke of Bretagne, by whom she left an only daughter,
Constance, who became the wife of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Geoffrey and the mother of Arthur,
son and grandson of Henry the Second; and after the death of Conan, to
Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Matilda, the youngest sister, died
unmarried in the same year as her brother Malcolm.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Amidst the deep affliction which he must have felt at the loss of
his only son, nothing was left undone by David that could ensure the
peaceful succession of his grandchildren. A crisis was even then
impending, for six months before the death of the prince of Scotland
Henry Fitz Empress had already landed in England, and Stephen,
whose good and gentle queen was no longer alive, seizing upon the
opportunity of Prince Henry’s death to strengthen his cause by a
fresh alliance, had at once made over Huntingdon to the Earl of
Northampton. Accordingly, under the charge of Duncan Earl of Fife,
upon whom the privileges of his earldom appear to have conferred this
office, Malcolm was dispatched throughout the Scottish provinces to be
acknowledged in every quarter of the realm as the heir and successor
of his grandfather, whilst the king, hurrying in person to Newcastle,
assembled the barons of Northumberland and took oaths and hostages for
their obedience to William, whom he presented to them as their future
feudal lord; and during the few short months he survived his son, he
busied himself in completing his arrangements for the regulation of the
kingdom in the event of his own decease.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span></p>

<p>The close of his career, indeed, was not far distant, for though his
intellect was still clear and vigorous, his bodily health was failing
fast, and though his friends would assure him that he had yet many
years to live, he felt in his own mind a presentiment that his end
was at hand. It was on a Wednesday towards the close of May that the
venerable monarch perceived the approach of death. Calmly reviewing his
last instructions, he suggested a few additions, and having concluded
his earthly affairs, dedicated his remaining hours to religion. Even
at such a moment his kindly nature beamed forth, and when almost
speechless he beckoned to his almoner, who, bending over the couch
of his dying master, heard him whisper his latest instructions for
the distribution of his daily alms. <span class="sni">A. D. 1153.</span> Thus he
lingered over the remainder of the week, and as the sun rose upon
the morning of the 24th, the spirit of the aged king returned to his
Maker.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>David was a good man as well as an able king. His faith was of the
age, but his religion was from the heart, and there are few who will
not respect the feeling that prompted his dying wish to be carried
to pray before the Black Rood of his mother. The times in which he
lived, and the peculiar tone of his mother’s mind, which is easily
traceable in all her children, may naturally have influenced the
character of his religion, but the formal and saintly colours in which
he is occasionally depicted, represent the actual living man about as
much, probably, as a mediæval portrait in stained glass resembles the
real features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> of the original. Strict in the conception of his own
religious duties, he was exact in requiring from the ecclesiastical
body a decorous abstinence from all internal broils and dissensions, in
return for the immunities and external peace he was zealous in insuring
them, enforcing obedience if necessary; though, it is said, that on one
occasion he was obliged to kneel to an obdurate churchman before he
could shame him into propriety. A kindly and warm-hearted disposition
is traceable in many of his acts, and is especially displayed in his
consideration and thoughtfulness for his poorer subjects. In accordance
with a regulation often found in other codes, and which was, probably,
a well-known and general maxim of law, no one was allowed to bring a
lesser cause into the royal court of justice, except as an appeal from
a lower court: yet, in spite of this enactment, which he seems to have
been the first to introduce into Scotland, he appointed certain days
on which, like an eastern king of old, he “sat in the gate” to give
audience to the poor and the aged; and he would turn without a murmur
from a hunting party to examine the appeal of a suppliant; if his
decision was contrary to the expectations of his humble petitioners,
kindly endeavouring to convince them of its justice—in too many
instances a thankless and hopeless undertaking. The poor and the
defenceless, indeed, were the especial objects of his protection, and
he passed a law that whenever anything belonging to them was stolen,
if only one man of good repute was ready to testify to the thief by an
oath sworn on the altar before proper witnesses, “according to Scottish
usage,” the stolen property was to be restored, “on the footing of the
king,” and an additional fine of “eight cows,” the usual mulct for
serious offences, levied on the offender—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> privilege of great moment
to the unprotected and oppressed in an age when, in ordinary cases, the
oaths of six, twelve, or even more men, were necessary to establish an
accusation of theft.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Conciliation may be described as the leading principle of David’s
policy. Called in the prime of life to reign over a people differing in
race, in habits, and in language, and agreeing only in the perpetuation
of hereditary feuds, he determined upon introducing, amongst his own
subjects, the more orderly and settled system of government with which
he and his brother Alexander were familiar during their lengthened
residence at the Anglo-Norman court; and so ably were his measures
conceived, and so judicious was his admixture of conciliation and
authority in carrying out this project,—which seems to have been
entertained by both brothers,—that he is said to have succeeded in
establishing a more durable state of concord amongst the heterogeneous
population of his kingdom, than existed at that period amongst
people enjoying far higher advantages. Perhaps the true secret of
his popularity lay in the admirable tact with which he seems to have
entered warmly into the subject that lay nearest to the hearts of all
his people—their own affairs. David had nothing to conceal except his
councils, and the royal chamber was accessible at all times; every one
in turn was favoured with an audience; the great and the lowly; the
churchman and the soldier the burgher and the peasant, each departing
with the assurance that his own interests were a matter of attention
and care to a watchful and paternal ruler.</p>

<p>Pursuing the policy inaugurated by his mother, Queen Margaret, he
encouraged the resort of foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> merchants to the ports of Scotland,
insuring to native traders the same advantages which they had enjoyed
during the reign of his father; whilst he familiarized his Gaelic
nobles, in their attendance upon the royal court, with habits of luxury
and magnificence, remitting three years’ rent and tribute—according to
the account of his contemporary Malmesbury—to all his people who were
willing to improve their dwellings, to dress with greater elegance,
and to adopt increased refinement in their general manner of living.
Even in the occupations of his leisure moments he seems to have wished
to exercise a softening influence over his countrymen, for, like many
men of his character, he was fond of gardening, and he delighted in
indoctrinating his people in the peaceful arts of horticulture, and
in the mysteries of planting and of grafting. For similar reasons he
sedulously promoted the improvement of agriculture, or rather, perhaps,
directed increased attention to it; for the Scots of that period
were still a pastoral, and, in some respects, a migratory people,
their magnates not residing, like the great feudal nobles, in their
own castles, and in the centre of their own “demesnes,” but moving
about from place to place—not always upon their own property—and
quartering themselves upon the dependant population. By enforcing
tillage and agricultural labour, and by directing laws against the
indolent listlessness of a pastoral life—for it was an age when, from
the reaction which might be expected after a period of “irregulated”
independence, even the common occurrences of every day life were often
made the subject of legal statutes—David hoped to convert the lower
orders into a more settled and industrious population; whilst he
enjoined the higher classes to “live like noblemen” upon their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
estates, and not to waste the property of their neighbours, and spare
their own, under pretence of continual journeys. In consequence of
these measures feudal castles began, ere long, to replace the earlier
buildings of wood and wattles rudely fortified by earthworks; and
towns rapidly grew up around the royal castles and about the principal
localities of commerce. The monasteries of Kelso, Jedburgh, Melrose,
and Holyrood, with many another stately pile, also owed their first
foundation to the fostering care of David; for, independently of his
religious zeal, he appreciated the encouragement afforded by such
establishments to the pacific arts it was his aim to introduce amongst
his subjects. The prosperity of the country during the last fifteen
years of his reign contrasted strongly with the miseries of England
under the disastrous rule of Stephen; Scotland became the granary
from which her neighbour’s wants were supplied; and to the court of
Scotland’s king resorted the knights and nobles of foreign origin, whom
the commotions of the Continent had hitherto driven to take refuge in
England.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>David, for his own purposes, encouraged this immigration by every means
in his power; for many of the events of his reign disclose the dilemma
in which he was occasionally placed between his nobility of native
birth, and the Anglo-Norman feudatories whose allegiance was also due
to the English crown. On the former he could count with safety in any
of his inroads upon the south, and to the latter he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> look for
assistance against the rebellions of the north and west; but there were
circumstances in which he could place entire dependance upon neither
party. If he threw himself into the arms of the native Scots he must
have resigned all hope of social improvement; but if he alienated their
affections and relied exclusively upon the Anglo-Normans, he must have
made up his mind to reconquer northern Scotland by force of arms, or
to resign it to some successful competitor. He gave, therefore, a
ready welcome to all who arrived unfettered by any tie to the English
king, depending on the knights for the creation of a baronage strongly
attached to his own interests, and equally to be relied upon against
Englishman and native Scot; whilst to the lower orders, whom he settled
in the towns, he looked for the promotion of commerce and the formation
of a burgherhood, devoted to the king from whom their privileges and
immunities were derived.</p>

<p>In furtherance of his contemplated innovations, and not a little also
of the views which he never ceased to entertain of still farther
aggrandizing his kingdom on her southern frontier, David may be said
to have laid the foundation of a radical change in the relative
importance of the two great divisions of feudal Scotland. Hitherto,
though the royal authority extended practically as far as the Spey,
and the king of Scots was obeyed nominally throughout the whole extent
of the mainland, the country between the Forth, the Tay, and the
central ridge of the Grampian range, was the real heart and centre of
<i>Alban</i>. Here were the royal capitals of Scone and Forteviot; here
the bishoprics of St. Andrews and Dunkeld, and Abernethy once also a
capital and bishopric, still an abbacy, and apparently the seat of the
learning of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> the age.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Here also were the religious foundations of
David’s parents, and of his brother Alexander; and here the late king
was wont to hold his court at his favourite residence of Invergowrie.
Southward of the Forth stretched Lothian and the ancient principality
of Strath Clyde, provinces still dependant on the kingdom beyond the
<i>Scots-water</i>, and never yet regarded as the seat of the central
authority. Northern Scotland may be compared to Wessex, the hereditary
province of the royal race and the centre of the English government;
the southern district between the Forth, the Solway, and the Tweed,
resembling the Danelage, secure in its own laws and customs, but
secondary in other respects to the remaining portion of the kingdom.
Southern Scotland was the creation of David. He embellished it with the
monasteries of his religious foundations; he strengthened it with the
castles of his feudal baronage; and here he established the nucleus of
feudal Scotland, and the foundation of that importance which eventually
transferred the preponderance in the kingdom to the south. Strath Clyde
and the Lothians were admirably adapted to his purpose, for all the
land appears to have been in direct dependance on the crown; he could
stud it at will with his favourite Anglo-Norman chivalry, and there
are no traces in either quarter of the powerful magnates who were in a
position, beyond the Scots-water, to oppose the policy of their king.</p>

<p>But it is not to be imagined that in any portion of the kingdom, except
in forfeited districts, David enacted the part of a conqueror, driving
out the earlier population and replacing the native proprietary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> by a
baronage of foreign origin. He was beloved by the Scots, and terrible
only to the men of Galloway, says his friend and biographer Ailred; and
it is impossible that he could have retained the affections of his own
people had he carried out a policy so hostile to their very existence.
He seems to have confirmed rather than destroyed proprietary right, and
though he introduced novel tenures into Scotland, the Thanes holding,
according to ancient custom, by Scottish service will be found, long
after his reign, side by side with the knights and barons holding by
the feudal tenure of military service. But this and other changes which
he accomplished, and the general policy he pursued in church and state,
will form the subject of the two succeeding chapters.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="subhed smcap">The State.</span></h2></div>

<p>Scotland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries still retained many
of the features of a confederated rather than of a consolidated
kingdom, acknowledging indeed, even in the earlier portion of that
period, the rule of one reigning family, but scarcely recognising the
authority of the same laws and customs, or bound together by the ties
of kindred, origin, and language. Between Forth and Tweed lay Lothian,
bordering towards the western frontiers upon the Cumbrian principality
and Galloway; both the former provinces having been annexed to the
Scottish crown by a course of successful aggression, if not by actual
conquest, though Galloway was still rather a tributary dependency than
an integral portion of the kingdom. Lothian, apparently, preserved
the same laws that were in force throughout Saxon Northumbria before
the reign of Canute; whilst two centuries of the dominion of a
Scottish line of princes over Cumbria must have introduced a Scottish
proprietary very generally throughout the province, without effecting
any material alteration in laws and customs, which, based upon the
Celtic principle of government, differed probably little, if at all,
from the code then and long afterwards retained in Galloway.</p>

<p>Northward of the Scots-water two great divisions were recognised,
<i>Scotia</i>, or Scotland proper, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> <i>Moravia</i>. The former
embraced the whole of the Lowland districts from the Spey to the
Forth, extending to the summit of the <i>Mounth</i> or Grampian range;
thus including the earldoms of Mar, Buchan, and Angus, Fife, Atholl,
Strathearn, and Menteith, with Gowrie and Stormont, the Merns and other
districts retained more directly in the king’s hands; together with the
whole of “Scottish Argyle,” which, before the creation of the shire and
bishopric, was connected with Atholl and the Abbacy of Glendochart;
whilst Cantyre and Cowal depended upon the earldom of Menteith.
<i>Moravia</i> was made up of the earldoms of Moray, forfeited in the
earlier portion of David’s reign; Caithness, which still included
Sutherland, then extending as far as Dingwall; and Ross, a sort of
debatable land between the <i>Gall-Gael</i>, <i>Oirir-Gael</i>, and
ancient Mormaors of Moray: with “Northern Argyle,” or that portion of
the territories of the <i>Oirir-Gael</i> which reached, at this period,
from the northern boundaries of the modern county to the frontiers of
the <i>Gall-Gael</i> in Sutherland.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Feudal tenure, in the later
Anglo-Norman acceptation of the word, was unknown throughout these
provinces at the accession of Alexander the First; though the earlier
system of government, once existing amongst a number of independent
tribes and confederacies, had long given place to the royal authority
wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> the rights of the crown—as was certainly the case in
<i>Scotia</i>—were thoroughly established. But though the principle
of the system was changed, the features remained very much the same;
and a nobility, owing their original appointment or confirmation to
the crown, exercising as deputies the privileges of the sovereign,
and retaining as their prerogative a portion of the dues they exacted
in his name, stood in the place of the elective or hereditary
magistrates of tribes and confederacies. The Thane, or <i>Tighern</i>,
and the official known as the <i>Deempster</i>, represented the
<i>Cean-cinneth</i>, or rather perhaps the <i>Toshach</i>, and the
<i>Brehon</i>—the chief, or captain, and the judge of the clan;
the earl or <i>Mormaor</i> the provincial judge answered to the
chosen leader and judge of the confederacy; the kindred of these
officials, and the <i>Og-tiernach</i>, or “lesser lords,” formed the
<i>Duchasach</i> and <i>Duine-uasal</i>, the gentry or freeholders of
the district; whilst none who could not claim to be enrolled amongst
one of these kindreds were entitled to the privileges of free or gentle
birth.</p>

<p>The only tenure known at this period was the <i>Gavel</i><a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> one
of the earliest forms of the original allotment, which was enjoyed
in common by all within the limit of the immediate kindred—or, in
Teutonic phrase, all embraced in the <i>Mæg-borh</i>—a permanent
property in such a holding only being acquired by uninterrupted
possession for the usual period of “three generations.” No fixed or
individual property, in the modern sense of the word, was conveyed
by such a tenure in any certain spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> of land as long as divisible
and inheritable property consisted of money, arms, and ornaments,
and the stock and produce of the land; but rather a right of
joint-occupancy in the family district or holding, shared by all who
could claim a certain degree of kindred with the Senior of the race.
The Senior was elective, every member of the kindred who had a right
of joint-occupancy also having an equal claim to choose the head of
his family; though under ordinary circumstances the precedency seems
to have been generally conceded to the actual representative of the
original “eldest born.” Seniority conferred privileges, but it also
entailed obligations. To every kindred occupant of a lesser holding
was assigned a portion of land, the Senior having the preference in
the choice of allotments, with a joint right to feed his live stock
on the common pasture, and a similar share in the house, barns, and
stabling; the possession of the hearth in the “capital messuage”
generally being included amongst the prerogatives of seniority. All
that was not partitioned out in this manner fell to the share of the
Senior, who in return for his privileges was responsible for the whole
of his kindred. He was their <i>plegius</i> or security, and their
spokesman on all occasions,—or, in the language of the Anglo-Saxon
laws, their <i>Borh</i> and <i>Fore-Speca</i>. He asserted their
joint rights, he avenged their joint wrongs, and he was answerable in
their joint names for the receipts or payments invariably following
injuries whether inflicted or received—for community in good or evil
was the very soul of the system of kindred—as well as for the due
exercise of hospitality whenever the “overlord,” to use the feudal
phrase, was entitled, on his <i>Cuairt</i> or Visitation, to demand the
“refection,” which was known amongst the Anglo-Saxons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> as “a night’s
feorm.” It may be safely assumed that similar features were exhibited
on a greater scale in the thanage, and in the holding belonging to
the district judge; the obligation of “refection” in the case of the
thane being confined to receiving the king, an earl, or an abbot or
bishop, according as he held office under a lay or ecclesiastical
superior. To judge from the parallel case of the Welsh nobleman, this
was generally on the occasion of the great winter circuit, when the
Scottish kings and magnates were accustomed to pass their Christmas
amongst their thanes, much as the kings and Jarls of Scandinavia were
wont, according to the old Icelandic chronicler, to move about during
the winter months amongst their baronage, or <i>Hersirs</i>, who held
their lands in a similar manner by the tenure of <i>Veitslo</i>, or
provisioning the king. The same rule may be supposed to have been
applicable to the earldom; whilst the principle of community of right
in the kindred unquestionably extended to ecclesiastical dignitaries
amongst the Gael, <i>Tanist</i> and <i>Adbhar</i> abbots—or the
successor actually chosen, and all capable of being nominated to the
abbacy—being continually met with in the Irish annals.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> It may
be gathered from the ancient Scottish laws that the limit of the
immediate kindred extended to the third generation, all who were fourth
in descent from a Senior passing from amongst the joint-proprietary,
and receiving, apparently, a final allotment; which seems to have been
separated permanently from the remainder of the joint-property by
certain ceremonies usual on such occasions. On the death of a Senior,
a redistribution of the land and offices belonging to the family
invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> took place; and it was at this period, probably, that all
who were beyond the limit of the immediate kindred received their final
allotment. The fourth in descent from a thane, no longer entitled to
his share amongst the joint-proprietary, or <i>Tigherns</i>, became
an <i>Og-tiern</i>, he and his descendants holding henceforth of
the representative of the Senior, by the same tenure as the thane
held of the king; the lapse of the necessary period in both cases
rendering them irremovable from their respective districts. The
<i>Tanist</i>, or next in succession—for the “law of Tanistry” is
only another phrase for the law of succession—was appointed at the
same time as the Senior, receiving an allotment in proportion to the
dignity of his office, and, at this period, generally holding the
<i>Toshachdorach</i>, or captaincy of the family,—which, in later
days, as the law of succession gradually altered, and the office of
Tanist sunk into disuse, seems to have become the especial prerogative
of the next in succession; and when the earldom, lordship, or thanage
passed out of the original family by female heiresses, was generally
confirmed by charter on the heir male, to be held hereditarily under
the head of the house. Nor was the <i>Toshach</i> a character confined
to the Celtic people alone; for the Mayor of the palace under the early
Merovingian sovereigns, who was usually elected at the same time as the
king, and was perhaps a member of the same royal race, was known as the
<i>Dux Francorum</i>; very much resembling the Gaelic <i>Toshach</i>,
and the dignitary whose title appears upon the early British coins
under the Latinized form of <i>Tascio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>Many of the features, indeed, displayed in the Celtic Gavel were not
in any way peculiar to the Celtic people, but will be found to have
very generally existed in every part of western and northern Europe,
wherever a portion of the population continued to hold their land by
the older system, which was stigmatized as <i>Roturier</i> after the
feudal theory of “knight-service” was recognised as the only principle
of “gentle tenure.” In the intermediate period, when the earlier system
still held its ground side by side with the principles of Roman law,
and the shifting allotment to which every member of the <i>Folk</i> or
<i>Leod</i> was entitled by “the right of blood” was passing gradually
into a fixed and permanent inheritance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> length of possession,
variously reckoned in different early laws, alone conferred pure
allodial property in land amongst the German people—for the chartered
grant from the king was thoroughly Roman—whilst throughout the North,
long uninfluenced by contact with Imperial Rome, the original principle
of descent, which was still traceable in the Germanic nobility of this
period, and in the “inborn” right acquired by the lower orders, was in
full force; the <i>Bonder</i> growing into the <i>Odal-Bonder</i>, and
if his blood was strictly pure, into the <i>Holder</i>, solely after
the lapse of the necessary number of descents. Long after the conquest
of the ancestral dukedom of the English kings by Philip Augustus of
France, the main features of the law of Tanistry, which seemed so
strange to the Anglo-Irish lawyers of the seventeenth century, were
still familiar to the Normans of the continental duchy. All the family
up to the sixth degree were joint proprietors with the Senior of the
race in the <i>Tenure-par-Parage</i>, holding by fealty alone, the
seventh in descent passing from amongst the privileged kindred and
holding by <i>homage</i>, thus becoming “<i>the man</i>” of the head
of the family, just as the fourth in descent by Scottish custom became
an <i>Og-tiern</i> under the Thane. The difference in the number of
descents was simply the result of the introduction of a noble class
above the free, and in either case, all who passed beyond the limits
of the kindred evidently had an “inborn” right to a fixed and final
provision.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> A similar principle seems to have regulated the holding
amongst the continental Angles, which never passed to an heiress until
the kindred could furnish no male heir within the necessary limit,
extending in this case to the fifth degree. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> <i>share-house</i> of
the Kentish <i>Gavel</i> (the <i>Bold-getal</i> perhaps of Alfred’s
laws), with the hearth reserved, as among the Welsh, for the youngest
heir; the allotment of which the name of <i>shifting</i> betokens
the original character; and the freedom of the heirs from the
consequences of the father’s felony, alluded to in the old Kentish
rhymes, “the father to the bough, the son to the plough,”—a freedom
which was confirmed, rather than introduced, in Scotland by the laws
of William,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>—closely resemble the characteristics of the Celtic
holding: though the preference of the youngest heir in the Welsh and
Kentish Gavel, and in the tenure known as <i>Borough-English</i>,
discloses the pre-existence of a state of society unknown, apparently,
amongst the Gael; whilst the allodial character of the Kentish Gavel
seems to have been almost peculiar to that county.</p>

<p>Both the principle of joint proprietary right, and the elective
character of the Senior, were thoroughly recognised in the Imperial
Benefice, at least as late as the eleventh century. The kindred, ending
at the seventh in descent, and never acquiring hereditary right before
the lapse of three generations, chose and presented their Senior to
their lord, their representative fulfilling all the obligations of the
benefice, which, being held by military service, differed in certain
particulars from the older Gavel.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Stated military service was
required for a stated portion of land, a well-armed soldier attending
his lord from every benefice, which was always originally of a certain
stated size, the holder of many being answerable for an equivalent
number of men-at-arms, whilst the responsibility in half a benefice
was shared between the Seniors of two such holdings. As the military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
feud required the service of a man-at-arms, it followed that the lord
was entitled to provide a substitute whenever such service could not
be rendered through the minority or sex of the heirs; and out of
this right arose the claim of the lord of a military fief to control
the marriage of the heiress, and to act as guardian of the minor,
rights which, in the case of the Gavel, belonged to the kindred. The
earlier system was ruled by a different principle of military service:
the greater the numbers of the family or tribe, the more prominent
their position in battle, the wider the district allotted to them in
the annual distribution of the land; and hence it was the pride of
the German <i>pagi</i>, in the days of Tacitus, to contribute a far
greater number of warriors than their necessary quota of “a hundred.”
The earlier principle was still in full force amongst the Celts,
every freeman continuing to carry arms, and to be liable at the call
of the king to attend the yearly assembly of the <i>Sluagh</i> or
<i>Leuchte</i>—the Welsh <i>Lluyd</i>, the German <i>Leudes</i>—if
required for a “hosting across the border;” a custom which was retained
side by side with the military service of the feudal system, under
the name of “Scottish service,” rendering an army thus levied, and
armed only with weapons of offence, more numerous indeed, but far less
effective, than the well-equipped body of mail-clad men-at-arms, who
were bound by the tenure of “knight-service” to follow their lord to
the field.</p>

<p>Wherever the adoption of the benefice had introduced the principle of
stated military service, the representatives of the earlier freemen
had invariably sunk into a class of agricultural peasantry, free,
but occupying an intermediate station between the noble and the læt
or serf. The soldier, for instance, amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> the Anglo-Saxons in the
seventh century was exclusively represented by the Thane, whilst the
member of the <i>folk</i> or people was only required to attend the
army in the capacity of a camp follower, unarmed and without either the
duties or responsibilities of a fighting man.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> No such intermediate
class is traceable amongst the Celts of this period, who had not yet,
apparently, entered upon that stage of society in which the noble rose
out from amongst the ranks of the free, as a member of a distinct and
separate caste. The equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon Ceorl—the Boneddig
or Bonnacht—continued to rank amongst the lesser <i>Duine-Uasal</i>
who lived by the sword, and whilst the title of <i>Churl</i> has passed
into an opprobrious epithet in the English language, the candidate
for a Welsh county still esteems it an act of courtesy to address his
constituency as <i>Boneddigion</i> or “gentlemen.” A wide, and in
most cases apparently an all but impassable barrier, separated the
<i>Duine-Uasal</i> from the agricultural population connected with the
land, a class which may be said, in a general way, to have comprised
all who were not connected by blood with the <i>Duchasach</i> of the
district, answering to the <i>Attach Tuatha</i> or <i>Daer-Clans</i>
amongst the Irish, and the <i>Alltudion</i> and earlier <i>Lætic</i>
population—the <i>Wealh</i>—amongst the Welsh and Germans. Captives
and criminals formed the absolutely servile class, for, to judge from
the Welsh laws, the <i>alien</i> enjoyed a certain degree of freedom,
being at liberty to change his residence as long as it was equally in
the power of his lord to remove him from his land; though after a lapse
of three generations in one locality, the fourth in descent acquired a
permanent right to remain in the ancestral dwelling, with a claim to
subsistence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> that district from which he was now irremovable. No
fixity of tenure was acquired by such a claim, which was simply a right
to receive every year from the <i>maor</i> or steward of the Tighern
a shifting allotment, representing literally the yearly assignment
of land alluded to in the descriptions of Cæsar and Tacitus; and at
the opening of the fourteenth century the agricultural population
throughout Scotland, as a class, still held their farms by a yearly
tenancy-at-will.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> By that time, however, the shifting character of
the allotment had probably undergone a certain qualification, for the
earliest law laid down in the first year of the reign of Alexander the
Second seems to have been directed against the unsettled condition of
these <i>Attach Tuatha</i>, and their predilection for the listless
indolence of a pastoral life. Every “Bondman” was ordered to plough and
sow the land in the same locality, or <i>Vill</i>, he had occupied in
the preceding year; all who had held no land but were in the possession
of five cows or upwards—in other words, of more than a pound—were
bidden to take land from their lord and raise a corn crop for his
benefit; whilst the proprietor of less than that amount of cattle
was to sell his oxen, if he had any, to those who could use them in
tillage, and work as a labourer in digging and sowing, equally for the
benefit of his lord.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The dependance of the <i>Duine-Uasal</i> for
their support upon the population thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> attached to the soil, ensured
to the latter a certain amount of consideration; for it was on his
“native-men” that the Tighern quartered his kinsmen and retainers, and
from the same agricultural class he levied his rents. The necessity of
a class of this description in such an age was its safeguard, up to a
certain point, from extortion and oppression; they were protected like
a sheep for its fleece, as long as their Tighern was in a condition to
defend them, the want of fixed and settled rights being invariably most
felt when society is in a state of transition.</p>

<p>Such then were the two great classes into which the whole population of
Scotland was at this time divided. Earls, Thanes, Judges, and Ogtierns,
with their respective kindred, composed the <i>Duchasach</i> or
<i>Duine-Uasal</i>, the free proprietary of the kingdom, together with
the lesser <i>Duine-Uasal</i> who dedicated their swords to the service
of their Senior, answering to the Welsh <i>Boneddigion</i>. Amongst
the numerous burdens which pressed so heavily upon the Irish peasantry
in the Anglo-Irish period, was the payment of a certain sum under
the name of <i>Bonnacht</i>, to relieve them from the necessity of
supporting their lord’s retainers; the existence of this custom amongst
the Irish Gael pointing to the manner in which, in a similar state of
society, the lesser <i>Duine-Uasal</i>, or <i>Bonnacht</i>, amongst the
Scottish Gael were quartered upon the native-men of their respective
districts. Nor must the abbot and his kindred, with <i>Duine-Uasal</i>
connected with the <i>ab-thanage</i>, be omitted from amongst the
<i>Duchasach</i>; whilst as there were “inborn” clergy, who at a
later date were numbered amongst the <i>Nativi</i>, and the son of a
chaplain by the laws of William lost his free-right upon the death of
his father, the law of descent which was in force amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> the laity
was evidently in operation amongst the clergy also.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> No especial
privileges of rank belonged to the ecclesiastical order in early times
amongst the people of Germanic origin; they were assessed according
to their actual birth, and it was an innovation upon ancient custom
amongst the Anglo-Saxons when the priest, “on account of his seven
orders,” was reckoned worthy of <i>Thane-right</i> or nobility. The
earlier custom was still in force apparently amongst the Celts; and as
none beyond a certain limit of the “Founder’s kin” were privileged to
succeed to the abbacy, so the descendants of the married clergy, beyond
a similar limit, would appear to have become attached as dependants to
the abbey lands; forming, probably, those bands of monastic warriors
whose occasional conflicts, recorded in the Irish Annals, seem to
have rivalled in ferocity the tumults of the eastern monks. The
kindred of the sovereign enjoyed the rank and appanages of earls, the
line of Atholl unquestionably, and perhaps that of Fife, branching
off permanently in this manner from the royal stock—just as the
ealdormen of Saxon Mercia towards the close of the tenth century traced
their origin to Ælfhere the kinsman of Edgar. The remaining earls
represented, either the “inborn” descendants of Mormaors appointed
at an earlier period over conquered districts; or the inheritors
of a province from an independent ancestry, who, acknowledging the
superiority of the king of Scots, continued to hold their territories
by hereditary right, resembling the ealdormen of Saxon Northumbria.
Of the earls of Scotia, the majority probably answered to the
former description, though the ancient earls of Strathern may have
represented, either an offshoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> from an earlier royal race, or the
descendants of a line of independent princes; whilst amongst the latter
class may be reckoned the forfeited earls of Moray, the earls of
Caithness, and perhaps of Ross, with the lords of Galloway and of the
Oirir-Gael.</p>

<p>The only recognised bond of union was the immemorial tie of kindred,
none being entitled to the privileges of gentle birth who could not
claim a certain degree of relationship to a Tighern or Og-tiern; none
being entitled to a right of subsistence whose kindred had not dwelt
for three generations in the district. Charters were unknown; a shake
of the hand before a witness settled a common bargain—the thirstier
southerns concluded such compacts with a <i>drink</i>—whilst the
delivery of a stick, a straw, or a clod of earth, in the presence of a
greater number of witnesses, apparently conveyed a more permanent grant
of land, though length of occupancy alone conferred hereditary right.
On important occasions a greater degree of ceremony was observed, one
of the latest displays of this description occurring in the reign
of Alexander the First, when the king restored to the Priory of St.
Andrews the tract of country known as the <i>Cursus Apri</i>, or “the
Boar’s Raik.” The king, in the presence of a vast concourse of people,
led up to the high altar his Arab charger, equipped with housings of
great value, and with a silver lance and shield; the royal saddle and
shield, with a complete suit of Turkish armour, being preserved in
the church of St. Andrews in testimony of the munificent donation.
Notices of such grants after the middle of the eleventh century were
occasionally preserved in writing, as <i>memoranda</i>, however, and
not as title-deeds; and instances of such <i>memoranda</i> are to be
found amongst the Irish and Welsh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> as well as amongst the Scots, in
the transitional period preceding the introduction of the regular
charter.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>The inevitable tendency of such a state of society was to call into
existence a class of lesser <i>Duine-Uasal</i>, clinging to the
privileges of gentle birth, and naturally averse to sink to the level
of the agricultural peasantry. The distant kinsman, removed beyond
the limit of the privileged branches of the family, was ever ready
to dedicate his sword to the service of the Senior of his race, and
was quartered upon the peasantry of the district as an <i>Amas</i> or
<i>Bonnach</i>, a member of the <i>Arimannia</i> or <i>Hird</i>; for
he was always certain of a welcome in an age in which the numbers of
such a following, useless except for purposes of aggression, were the
source and evidence of a chieftain’s power. Expansion thus became a
vital necessity, the very numbers of a kindred, which entailed the
obligation, generally ensuring success in their encroachments on a
weaker neighbour; and the same causes that impelled one German tribe
upon another, or precipitated them in one mighty wave upon the Roman
frontier, ensured a normal state of warfare amongst the Celts. Scotland
was, however, in a far less disorganized condition than Ireland at
this period; and though the royal authority was comparatively of
little use in repressing internal warfare amongst the mountains of
<i>Moravia</i> and Argyle, it was of greater power in the more open
districts of Scotland proper, and the south, where the magnates no
longer mustered their followers for “a hosting beyond the frontier”
except at the sovereign’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> command. Oppression and encroachment had
taken the place of open warfare, and they were content to quarter their
followers upon a weaker neighbour, and to relieve the native-men of
their own district by moving about from place to place under pretence
of travelling, or of attending upon the royal court, with a retinue
numerous enough to support their own dignity, and ensure for themselves
and followers the necessary hospitality known as “herbary.” It was to
protect themselves against the abuses of such a system, which was long
in full force amidst the mountains of the north and west, that the
lesser barons at a later period entered into bonds of <i>Manred</i>—or
of allegiance in return for protection—with the greater magnates,
whose power and dignity were thus enhanced; such engagements being
only the <i>chartered</i> form of the same tie that united, in an
earlier period, the Gallic and Germanic <i>clientes</i> to the
greater confederacies upon whom they were dependant: for wherever the
circumstances of the age called it forth, the principle of clientage
was sure to be developed.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Few material changes had been introduced beyond the Scots water, in
either church or state, when the youngest and greatest of Malcolm
Ceanmore’s sons succeeded his brother upon the throne. Malcolm was
a Gaelic king to the last, and the reforming energy of Margaret was
directed to the court and clergy; she scarcely aimed at effecting any
radical change in the principles of government. During the reigns of
Duncan and of Donald, Scotland must, if anything, have retrograded
rather than advanced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> remaining stationary apparently whilst Edgar
was king—to judge from the little that is known of that period—the
disorganized condition of the see of St. Andrews, which was vacant
during the whole of these three reigns, typifying probably the general
state of the kingdom at large. Sufficient occupation was afforded
Alexander by his contest with the church, which was scarcely brought
to a close with his life, and by his northern wars; and though, from
the presence of some of the great feudal officers of the crown, and of
<i>Vicecomites</i>, on certain state occasions during his reign, it may
be gathered that his policy was identical with that of his successor,
David may be safely regarded as the first king who practically
introduced into Scotland the novel system of government in church and
state, which was hardly thoroughly established before the opening of
the thirteenth century. Many of the institutions and principles which
had grown into use, more or less, upon the Continent through the
gradual substitution of Roman law for the earlier Teutonic custom, and
which had been adopted by successive sovereigns of Alfred’s race in
the reconstruction of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, were now substituted
in a similar manner for the earlier laws and customs of Scotland; some
of these changes being carried out at once, whilst in other cases
a considerable time elapsed, after the first introduction of the
principle, before it was thoroughly in operation throughout the country.</p>

<p>There was a period in early Frankish history, when the <i>Comes</i> or
<i>Graphio</i> was a royal deputy, answerable for the due collection
of the royal revenue, and exercising over the population, dependant
on the Crown, as fiscal-judge, a jurisdiction which did not extend
over the allodial proprietary. None of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> attributes belonged to
the <i>Count</i> of a later era, who, no longer either a fiscal-judge
or a collector of the royal revenue, was simply a greater baron,
enjoying only the title and dignity of his former office. A similar
change was in progress amongst the Anglo-Saxons, for in the reign
of Ini, the king’s ealdorman was the leading judge of the shire,
forfeiting his district for compounding a felony; and in Alfred’s
days, no man of a certain class could pass from one shire to another
without permission from the king’s ealdorman, who was still connected
with the shire as the leading personage in the <i>Gemote</i>, and
appealed to, on certain occasions, as an official. In Edward’s laws,
however, and in the laws of subsequent kings, the sovereign addresses
his <i>Gerefas</i> alone, without any allusion to the jurisdiction of
the ealdorman; and though the presence of the bishop and the ealdorman
at the <i>Shire-Gemote</i> was required by Edgar’s law, confirmed by
Canute, the Norman Conquest seems to have found the sheriff, a royal
official, and not the <i>Earl</i>—who was a <i>Duke</i> rather than
a <i>Count</i> at this period—the presiding officer in the county
court.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It appears to have been one of the leading features of the
policy introduced by Alexander and David, to carry out an alteration of
this character in Scotland, where the Earl and the Thane—the Mormaor
and the Maor—like the Jarl and the <i>Lenderman</i> and <i>Stallr</i>
amongst the Northmen, were still invested with the full authority of
royal officials. In the Welsh Commot, which was supposed to be divided
by law, or custom, into twelve <i>maenols</i>, only one of these
divisions was the actual property of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> <i>Maer</i>, who exercised
a joint authority with the <i>Cynghellwr</i> over the whole district,
one-third of the Commot being composed of <i>Taog-trefs</i>, occupied
by royal villeins, in other words, being royal <i>demesne</i>; and
from the division of the crown lands in Scotland at a later period
into <i>Thanages</i> and <i>Demesne</i>, it may be gathered that the
thanage was by this time restricted to the actual property of the
thane, who, no longer exercising authority over the demesne as a royal
official, was simply a hereditary tenant by rent, holding by Scottish
service instead of by knight service. In the same manner, the authority
of the Earl or Mormaor—a character unknown in the principality of
Wales, but who was simply a high steward or <i>Maer</i> on a greater
scale,—appears to have been limited to his actual earldom, the
functions which he had hitherto discharged as a royal deputy devolving
on the <i>Vicecomes</i>, an official newly introduced, and directly
dependant on the sovereign; in certain cases standing in the same
relation to the royal thanes and the tenantry on demesne lands, as
the baron by military service did to the knights and tenantry of his
barony. Thus, for instance, the great sheriffdom of Perth was made up,
probably, of all the thanages and demesne lands withdrawn from the
superintendence of the various earls, of whose ancient Mormaordoms the
greater portion is now included in the modern county. In Gowrie there
was an earldom and a regality, both remaining under the jurisdiction of
the sheriff of Scone, as long as they were both retained in the king’s
hands; though, had the earldom been granted away, the authority of the
Vicecomes would have been limited to the regality. In Fife alone the
Earl continued in the thirteenth century to exercise the prerogatives
of a royal Maor; and when Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> the Second, in accordance with
the original gift of David, issued his writs for assigning one-eighth
of the profits and fines of Fife and Fortrev to Dunfermlyn, one writ
was directed to the sheriff of Fife, the other to Earl Malcolm and his
bailies, directing him to make over to the abbey “the eighth, which
<i>ye levied with us</i> in the county.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The sheriffdom, however, was introduced by degrees; and in Scottish
Argyle, and in Cantyre and Cowal, the duties which devolved in
<i>Moravia</i> on the Vicecomes of Inverness were still performed by
the Earls of Atholl and Menteith, or the Abbot of Glendochart. David
still addressed his mandate in behalf of the abbey of Dunfermlyn to
“the earl and proprietary of Caithness and the Orkneys;” and when, in
the subsequent reign, Malcolm issued a mandate of the same description
to the Earl of Ross, it was similarly addressed to “Earl Malcolm and
his thanes.” Four centuries elapsed before there was more than one
sheriffdom in ancient <i>Moravia</i>—a sure sign of the weakness of
the royal authority in early times in the distant north, when the
earl, if so inclined, was probably a more efficient delegate to carry
out the king’s decrees than the royal Vicecomes of Inverness. Even in
Fife the Sheriff is not traceable before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> the days of William, David
always addressing, “the bishop, earl, and proprietary of Fife,” and
directing “my judge of that province” to assist at the court of the
Abbot of Dunfermlyn; in the same manner as it was incumbent on the
sheriff, or his substitute, to be present at a later period on similar
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Gradually, however, in all the settled portions of
Scotland, the Vicecomes assumed the prerogative of the royal Maor;
amongst other duties, settling the rents of the demesne lands, much
as his type, the English Sheriff, assessed the <i>ferms</i> levied
upon the royal Hundreds or Wapentakes included in his shire. In both
countries the sheriffdom occasionally became hereditary, until a
statute of Edward the Third fixed a year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> as the limit of the English
Sheriff’s tenure of office. Permanency, and a certain degree of greater
dignity, seem still to have attached to the Vicecomes in Scotland,
where the equivalent of the lord-lieutenant of an English county is
known at the present day as “lieutenant and <i>sheriff</i> of the
shire,” the acting official being the <i>sheriff-depute</i>, the tenure
of whose office is equally permanent.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>As it was the policy of the race of Alfred to knit together the whole
of Southern England and the Danelage in the bonds of Commendation, or
<i>hlaford-socn</i>, so amongst the first principles of the system of
government introduced by David, it was strictly enacted, that, within
a fortnight after the proclamation of the king’s writ in the royal
<i>Moot</i>, every man “should find him a lord,” or forfeit the usual
mulct of eight cows to the king, and remain at the royal mercy until
he had duly commended himself to some responsible person. So necessary
was this enactment considered for insuring the internal peace of the
kingdom, and the practical dependance of its unruly population upon the
sovereign, that it was a royal axiom in the reign of David’s grandson,
William, that any man accused of theft, who could not “find a lord” to
be his surety, was to be at once treated as a convicted felon; though
such must have been the difficulty of enforcing it in the remoter
districts, that four centuries after the first introduction of the
principle, enactments were still occasionally levelled against “the
broken clans” of the Highlands and Borders.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Violence and robbery,
the usual crimes of a lawless age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> were severely dealt with, and the
sanctity of the <i>Gryth</i> strictly enforced, its “infraction”—in
other words a breach of the peace—being heavily fined, according to
the rank and dignity of the personage whose <i>gryth</i> or peace
was broken. All the district up to a certain limit around the kings
court and person, and all the public highways, were “in pace regis,”
or under the immediate protection of the king; whilst the earldom,
the barony, and the thanage were under the similar protection of
the proprietors, whether lay or clerical, who were entitled to the
privileges of a court. For threatening to strike within the limits of
the royal <i>gryth</i>, four cows were paid to the king, one to the
party threatened; the oaths of two “liel men” being required in proof
of the charge. For an actual blow the fine was raised, increasing in
proportion, if blood followed; a drawn dagger was struck through the
hand; and if the weapon were used, and with effect, the guilty hand
was forfeited—a stern enactment, enforced five centuries later by
the Star-Chamber;—whilst if death followed the blow, the full fine
of one hundred and eighty cows was paid to the king, the kindred
receiving that “satisfaction according to the law of Scotland”—the
<i>cro</i> or wergild—from which the victim could no longer hope
to profit.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Petty thefts were summarily dealt with; the man
detected <i>backberand</i>—with a calf, a sheep, or anything he
could carry on his back—was mulcted of a cow or a sheep by the lord
of the property, was well scourged, and lost an ear, the presence of
two “liel men” being required to carry out the punishment. None were
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> be hanged for less than the value of two sheep, each reckoned
at sixteen pence, or an <i>ore</i>.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The usual form of robbery,
however, was “cattle-lifting,” or the <i>Creagh</i>, a relic of that
lawless state of society in which the property of all who were not
connected by the ties of blood, or of intimate alliance, was looked
upon as the lawful spoil of the strongest. The <i>Creagh</i> was on
land what the <i>Sumorlida</i> was by sea; lawful warfare when carried
on under the royal authority, but robbery and piracy if wanting the
sanction of the sovereign power; which, as “the confederacy” was
gradually bound in the firmer bonds of “the kingdom,” was invariably
directed against the Cateran and the Viking, the last relics of that
barbarous independence which claimed the right of private warfare.
The rules laid down in the early Frank and Anglo-Saxon laws for
tracing the perpetrators of a robbery, leave little room for doubt
that, with the Frank and the Saxon, as with the Gael, there was a
time when “lost property” was but another word for stolen cattle.
It was to check the increase of “cattle-lifting,” against which the
ordinary night watches—the <i>stretward</i> or road-guard of the
Conqueror’s laws—were thoroughly inefficient, that the early Frank
kings instituted the Canton, or Hundred, laying the responsibility of
the theft upon the district in which it occurred: and as such robberies
were generally carried out at night, the watch-dog was considered by
David an animal of sufficient importance to justify the enactment of
a special law, and whoever killed him was bound to watch his master’s
house for a year and a day, being answerable during that period for
any losses that might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> incurred. It was probably to check this
tendency to night robbery that a law, very much resembling the Norman
regulation of the <i>Couvre-feu</i>—which may have been introduced
for a similar reason—was either passed, or confirmed, in the reign of
William, forbidding all but men in authority, or responsible persons,
from leaving their homes after nightfall, except to fetch a priest to
a sick man, to go to the mill, or to do the bidding of their lord; he
who was abroad after dark on an errand of this description being bound
to declare openly the reason of his absence from home. But the measures
of David were not confined to the protection of the watch-dog, and
he laid down rules for the course to be pursued in cases of robbery,
assimilating his regulations to the usages elsewhere in force.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>By Anglo-Saxon law, all property above a certain value was to be
bought in open market, and in the presence of <i>Witnesses</i>, who
were always men of property and good repute—the Reeve, the Landlord,
the Priest, or other “unlying men” of similar station, who were
chosen for this and other purposes in every <i>Burh</i> and Hundred.
No sale was legal without a <i>Warranter</i>, who guaranteed that
the property offered for sale was honestly acquired; and if it was
subsequently claimed within a certain period as stolen goods, the
purchaser was bound to produce his witnesses and the warranter, the
responsibility from that time resting upon the latter. If he failed to
appear the purchase was void, though the oaths of the witnesses cleared
the purchaser from the legal consequences of theft; but if neither
witnesses nor warranter came forward in his behalf, he was at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
condemned as a thief. The name of the warranter was <i>Getyma</i>,
whilst the legal process, which was always numbered amongst the
privileges of the Baron’s Court at this period, was known as
<i>Team</i>, and was a part of that system which aimed at supplanting
the rude personal independence which answered every accusation by
an appeal to the sword.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The equivalent of the <i>Getyma</i>
amongst the Welsh was known as the <i>Mach</i>, and he seems to
be traceable in the Salic law under the name of <i>Hamallus</i>,
the prototype apparently of the Norman <i>Heimil-borch</i>, or
<i>Hemold-borh</i>—perhaps even of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Getyma</i>—the
similarity of the title by which the warranter was known beyond the
Tweed, or rather perhaps beyond the Forth, <i>Hamehald</i>, pointing to
the quarter from which the regulations of the <i>Team</i> would appear
to have been introduced, at any rate beyond the “Scots-water.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
In pursuance of this system, of which the germs are earliest found
in force amongst the Franks, David appointed certain places in every
Scottish sheriffdom to which all property “challenged for theft” was to
be brought, and all the warranters in such cases were to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> summoned.
Scone, Cluny, Logierait and Dalginch were the places named for Gowrie,
Stormont, Atholl, and Fife; Kintulloch for Strathearn; Forfar and
Dunottar for Angus and the Mearns; and Aberdeen for Mar and Buchan.
Inverness was named for Ross and Moray, whilst Stirling was the place
appointed for transactions in which “the men beyond the Forth” were
implicated; for though in modern times this description would apply to
the northern Scots, when Scone was the capital and Gowrie the heart
of the kingdom, “all beyond the Scots-water” meant the inhabitants of
the Lothians, Cumbria, and Galloway. Just as amongst the Franks forty
days were allowed the accused to collect his evidence within Ardennes
and the Loire, eighty if the parties required dwelt beyond these
limits;—the time varying amongst the Anglo-Saxons from one week to
four, according to the distance of the shire from which the evidence
was summoned, six weeks and a day being allowed for all “beyond
sea,”—so if the warranter was within the limits of <i>Scotia</i> the
challenged party was bound to produce him in a fortnight, an additional
month being allowed if he dwelt beyond the borders: and as it is
obvious that there must occasionally have been considerable difficulty
in procuring the attendance of a reluctant <i>Hamehald</i>, his lord
was bound to enforce his attendance under penalty of forfeiting one
hundred cows, the recusant himself being mulcted in three times the
value of the challenged property, whilst he who failed his warranter
was proclaimed an outlaw. Every assistance in the search was to be
given by the Vicecomes and his officers—the Sheriff of Inverness being
answerable for the whole of <i>Moravia</i>, whilst the Earl of Atholl,
or the Abbot of Glendochart, were responsible for Scottish Argyle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> and
the Earl of Menteith for Cantyre and Cowal, the sheriffdom being as
yet unknown throughout the territories of the <i>Oirir-Gael</i>.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Considerable light is thrown by these regulations upon the comparative
dependance of different parts of Scotland upon the crown during the
reign of David; and as they are not extended to the Lothians, which
remained under the jurisdiction of the Northumbrian ealdormen for
nearly a century after similar rules appear in the Anglo-Saxon codes,
it may be inferred from this silence, not that the law was not enforced
throughout southern Scotland, but that the <i>Team</i> was a familiar
process to the population between Forth and Tweed, at the time when
David first extended its provisions over the rest of his kingdom.</p>

<p>Very stringent rules were either enforced, or confirmed, in a
subsequent reign for all cases in which a priest was called as
warranter. The necessity of open dealing in all transactions connected
with property was enforced upon the clergy by rendering it unlawful
for a priest to receive gift or tithe except in the presence of “good
and true men”—the <i>Witnesses</i> probably of a bargain between
laymen—and he could not be summoned as a warranter without the
testimony of “three leal men,” evidently the witnesses in question.
If he named the donor, when the gift was challenged, and produced his
three witnesses, the responsibility was shifted upon the person named,
who, in addition to any other penalties, was bound to make good the
value of the gift to the priest; and if the latter stated that the
claimed property was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> own, or, if cattle, reared by himself, his
assertion was to be corroborated by the oaths of “three leal men;”
and to guard against all undue influence, their credibility was to be
vouched for by the lord of the Vill. It was not from any suspicion of
the ecclesiastical body that the law required their evidence to be thus
corroborated on such occasions, but rather from a perfect appreciation
of the practice, not confined to cattle-lifters, of compounding for a
course of evil doing by dedicating a portion of ill-gotten gains to
the church. Hence the necessity of the lord of the Vill vouching for
the credibility of the witnesses, thus becoming responsible for the
penalties of their perjury; for the priest who was capable of receiving
stolen goods would have scarcely hesitated at exercising the influence
of his sacred character amongst ignorant, or unscrupulous, parishioners
in order to clear himself from the consequences of his offence.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The strictest regulations, however, would have been of little avail
without securing the co-operation of the magnates of the land, whose
right to hold a court with the privileges of “pit and gallows,”
which in this reign carried with it jurisdiction in cases of theft
and homicide, must have rendered such co-operation absolutely
essential. Undue leniency towards offending relatives or dependants,
and occasionally connivance in a <i>Creagh</i> for a share of the
spoil—for a gift might purchase immunity from the overlord as well
as absolution from the priest—must have been of only too frequent
occurrence in an age in which escape from the gallows was so likely an
event, evidently through a fellow feeling with the criminal, that the
very first law in the collection ascribed to David, whilst ensuring
the actual offender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> against a second hanging for the same offence,
visited the consequences of his escape upon the officiating party as
a crime of more than ordinary magnitude. Hence, as it was incumbent
upon every freeman to seek the protection of a lord, it was equally
necessary that such protection should be restrained within just and
proper limits; and for “selling a thief” for money, friendship, or any
other consideration whatever, a mulct of a hundred cows was levied upon
an earl, or upon any magnate enjoying the rights and privileges of an
earl—a description probably embracing the greater barons, the officers
of state, the higher clergy, and subsequently the lords of Galloway,
Argyle, and the Isles. The fine was reduced to thirty-four cows in the
case of personages of lesser dignity; whilst if a thief escaped from
prison, the lord of the prison was bound to clear himself from all
complicity by the oaths of three Thanes and twenty-seven “good men and
true;” the triple oath, in other words, of three Thanedoms or Baronies.
The complicity of “the Baronage” in offences of this description was,
but too often, a fruitful source of disorder; and in the subsequent
reigns, the practice of taking money for “remission of judgment” was
punished by withdrawing from “the lord,” found guilty of such an
abuse, all further right of “holding a court:” and if, in return for
a gift or rent of any description, he granted his protection to a man
accused of crime, who was proved by the verdict of “the good men of the
country” to be neither liegeman nor native-man of his protector, he
was condemned for so doing to be “at the king’s mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Laws and
enactments, however, are of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> little avail unless the lawmaker has the
power of enforcing them, and long after the rule of the House of Atholl
had passed away, the Scottish magnates, though capable of exercising
their “rights of regality” in a very summary manner, were only too apt
to overlook, if not to connive at, the excesses of an useful follower;
though a true idea of the state of Scotland under the later successors
of David would scarcely be gathered from confounding it with the state
of the same country in the fourteenth, perhaps even in the following
century; during which period the kingdom, at any rate in its more
settled and civilized quarters, had decidedly retrograded rather than
advanced from its condition in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Amongst the regulations either introduced, or confirmed, by David, at
any rate beyond the Scots-water, the system of the <i>Voisinage</i>,
or <i>Visnet</i>, holds a prominent place; through which the older
forms of trial were gradually supplanted by the verdict of “the good
men and true” of the neighbourhood. Two principles seem to have lain at
the root of the whole system of justice—compurgation, and the ordeal.
As individuality was unrecognized, or helpless, the testimony of a
single witness was, except under certain circumstances, inadmissible;
though the oath of a man of rank, or of a churchman, after the church
had acquired worldly station, outweighed the oath of an inferior,
and seems often to have been reckoned according to the proportion of
their wergilds. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> amongst the Anglo-Saxons, two thanes appear
to have answered to twelve compurgators of lesser note; five thanes
to the triple oath of thirty in Wessex, though the number of the
triple oath varied in Wessex, Mercia, and the Danelage; and a similar
principle is traceable in the laws of the kindred Old Saxons of the
Continent.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> <i>Compurgation</i> was originally the duty of the
kin, and the nearest relatives who received, or paid, the wergild were
bound to come forward to take oath in behalf of any member of the
brotherhood, every accusation being thus supported or repelled. The
number of compurgators varied according to the importance of the case,
judgment going against the party whose kin declined to come forward, or
who failed in obtaining the required number. The accusation frequently
had to be repelled by a number of compurgators doubling the amount of
those who supported the charge; and on some occasions, to judge from
the custom of the Imperial Benefice, each party went on increasing
in number until the greater <i>tourbe</i>, the most numerous body of
compurgators, carried the day; or else a final appeal seems to have
been made to the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Witnesses, in the modern sense of the
word, are seldom or never alluded to; had they been examined, and borne
testimony against a man, as at present, they would have legally had
to “bear the feud” of his kindred—a danger actually provided against
by one of William’s laws. In an age in which the duty of revenge was
amongst the paramount obligations of the family tie, the kindred, in
such a case, were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> too ready to wreak their vengeance on all
through whom their kinsman suffered; an offence which was visited with
the highest fine for a breach of “the kings peace,” except the victim’s
kindred had consented to the deed—had, in other words, declined “to
bear the feud.” The extent to which the blood-feud was acknowledged, at
this period, may be gathered from a proviso in the same law, that even
if the king had “granted grace” to the offending parties, his pardon
was of no avail unless it had been issued with the full knowledge of
the kindred of the slaughtered man, who otherwise retained their legal
right of vengeance on the homicide.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The liability of the kindred,
however, must have enabled the jurisprudence of the age, in ordinary
cases, to dispense with witnesses. The responsibility of the theft, or
homicide, was thrown upon the district; and if the responsible parties
failed to shift it elsewhere, the law visited them with the penalty.
Publicity was the test of innocence, secresy of guilty intent. In
the olden time, all who crossed the <i>mark</i> openly were welcomed
as guests, safe and secure in the protection of the whole people,
amongst whom they were sacred characters; but he who failed to give
due notice of his approach, was slain at once as a foe or a thief; and
in later days, the magnate travelling through the royal forest might
always strike a deer or two if he first sounded his horn, to give due
notice to the forester of his intention. He who slew his foe in open
strife, proclaimed the deed, and told where the body lay—sometimes
even if he left his weapon sticking in the wound—was never reckoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
as a murderer, simply bearing the feud with his kindred, or paying
the wergild; whilst by Old Saxon law, a <i>murderer</i> was fined
nine times the ordinary mulct, his kinsmen only paying one-third of
the usual wergild as their share of the fine, and being released from
all consequences of the feud; evidently on the principle of their
ignorance of the <i>secret</i> intentions of the murderer.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> So, at
a later date, it was the duty of the man who claimed his own cattle,
or “impounded” that of another for debt, to proclaim it openly in the
neighbourhood; when his neighbour, thus made aware of his intentions,
might stop him if in the wrong, and assist or clear him on oath if
right. Thus, publicity was necessary in all the transactions of social
life; and as its neglect was assumed to imply a guilty purpose, and the
kin, or the neighbourhood, was the joint security for all its members,
it would naturally become a legal axiom of the age, that the kinsmen,
or neighbours, were responsible that such publicity had been complied
with, and liable to pay the penalty of any neglect.</p>

<p>For all who doubted their ability to muster the requisite number
of compurgators—but too often, it is to be feared, for the
friendless—the ordeal was the last resource; either water, cold
or boiling; hot iron; or the wager of battle.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In primitive
societies the sword has ever been the freeman’s last appeal—still
remaining so where they congregate in numbers sufficient to constitute
a separate state—and the early Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> looked upon every other
mode of settling a disputed question as a novel and unheard of
method of proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Many of the rights which have long been
made over to the state were in early times supposed to be vested in
every <i>full-born</i> member of the community, continuing until a
comparatively recent period, to be more or less enjoyed by the great
and privileged; and it must have been the aim of the early lawgiver to
control and regulate rights which he could not supersede; just as in
Scotland the royal official directed the judgment of the Barons’ Court
long before he superseded its jurisdiction. As long as the constituted
authorities were too weak, or too feebly supported, to retain the
sword of justice in their own hands, it is evident that it remained
in the power of every free kindred to execute the vengeance which the
laws allowed; and when the suit had not been compounded, or the feud
appeased, the criminal, instead of being “left for execution,” was
simply handed over to the <i>legal</i> vengeance of his enemies; just
as amongst the Israelites of old it was not from the official, but
from the avenger of kindred blood, that the unintentional homicide
fled to the city of refuge. Men, under certain circumstances, were
allowed “to take the law into their own hands;” the thief caught by the
“sequela clamoris viciniæ”—the hue and cry of the neighbourhood—with
the stolen cattle in his possession, was hung without ceremony; and
in their rules for tracing stolen cattle, the men of London-burh were
bidden to be foremost, not in delivering the thief to justice, but in
taking prompt and summary vengeance on him. The regulations in the
Anglo-Saxon laws for clearing the man slain for a thief, show that
the well-known proverb about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> “Jeddart justice,” has been scarcely
exaggerated—“Hang first and try afterwards.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> The wager of battle
naturally arose out of such a state of society, when the “ultima ratio
regum,” with other royal prerogatives, was regarded as the right of
every full-born freeman; and the same arguments, which are now used to
palliate warfare between states, might then have been urged in favour
of the freeman’s last appeal. <i>Disseisin</i>, when the freeman was
dispossessed of his property, was simply invasion on a lesser scale;
and as long as the central authority was inefficient to rectify the
wrong, and reinstate the rightful owner, all that it could promise
was “non-intervention,”—open lists for the combat, and death to all
who interfered; whilst in doubtful charges affecting a man’s life, it
was quite in accordance with the rude justice of the age, that, as a
last resource, the accused might defend his head with his hand. The
challenger faced the west, the challenged party the east, and he who
was defeated lost all “right” for ever; though, if he “craved” his
life, he might live as a “recreant,” a <i>craven</i> who “recanted”
the perjury he had sworn to; so that most brave men must have fought
to the death. Compurgation, which passed into the English law as “the
wager of law,” and was not quite forgotten in the Perthshire highlands
in the early part of the seventeenth century, was probably one of the
first compromises of the ancient “wager of battle”—perhaps suggested
by the softening influence of Christianity<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>—the same number of
the kindred who formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> the <i>Wer-borh</i>, or cleared their kinsman
on oath, having, perhaps, in early times, like the second in a duel of
the seventeenth century, stood beside him occasionally in the actual
combat, or kept the ground during its progress—one of the latest
instances in Scotland of such a combat on a great scale being, perhaps,
the well-known contest on the North Inch of Perth.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Compurgation and ordeal seem to have been as familiar to the Celts as
to the Teutons, until by degrees the system known of old in English
law as the “Jugement del Pais,” superseded all the earlier methods of
trial. Amongst the early Germans, a leading magnate, or prince, was
chosen in the yearly meeting to judge the people, making the tour of
the whole confederacy, with a hundred <i>comites</i> to assist and
support him in his decisions; the <i>Vergobreith</i> amongst the Gauls
being a very similar character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> though, from the peculiar separative
principle of Gallic policy, the Druids supplied the place of the
Comites, the exposition of the law being one of the prerogatives of
the sacred caste. Every freeman, therefore, was tried in the open
<i>Mall</i>, or court, of his own district by a judge, in whose
appointment he was supposed to have a voice; and in the presence of his
equals, or of the class to which all legal and religious obligations
were deputed. For his family, his <i>Hird</i> or followers, his
<i>Lœts</i> and serfs—for all who were in his <i>mund</i> or under
his protection—he was himself the judge; and as the class of Comites
increased in numbers, a greater body of freemen was transferred, so
to say, from the jurisdiction of the public to that of the private
judge, thus exhibiting the spectacle of a free population living, in
a certain sense, according to different laws. This is nowhere better
exemplified than in the case of Sweden in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, when the whole of the Bonders, or allodial proprietary,
were under the jurisdiction of their chosen <i>Lagaman</i>, none of
“the king’s men” having a right to enter the Bonders’ Court without
their permission, where, when the king was present, the Lagaman sat
on a raised seat opposite the royal throne, on the footing of all
but equality.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> A similar spectacle may have been exhibited, in a
certain stage of society, wherever a kingdom arose out of a number of
small allodial communities; but after the various members of the Frank
confederacy were united in one kingdom, under the race of Merovic,
the different laws acknowledged in the historical period were, not
allodial and royal, but Salic and Roman—a distinction generally
observable wherever a people of Teutonic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> race settled as conquerors
in the Roman provinces. Amongst the Burgundians, indeed, where the
Roman and his conqueror were on a footing of comparative equality, two
royal officials administered justice in the same court, each people
being judged by a Count of their own race, and according to the laws
of Gundobald, or the code of Rome; but with the Franks, amongst whom
the Roman was an inferior, there was but one official, the Graphio, or
Judex Fiscalis, whose authority extended, though in a different degree,
over both races. The Roman was judged solely by the royal official,
who was bidden when in doubt “to read the Roman law;”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> but in all
cases in which the Frank was tried by the old Salic law, the official,
whether <i>Missus</i> or Fiscal judge, simply pronounced the sentence,
the real judges of the cause being the <i>Scabini</i>. Originally
seven in number, latterly twelve, the Scabini were always chosen by
the Graphio, or the Missus, from amongst the “Meliores Pagenses,” or
leading proprietary of the district in which the cause was tried;
and in cases of doubt reference was made, not to a written code, but
to “nostrum placitum generale,” representing the whole community in
general <i>Mall</i> or meeting; just as the Scabini represented the
“proportio visnetæ,” or the chosen portion of proprietors acting in the
name of the whole neighbourhood. The same principle was extended to
every lesser court, whether public or private; three <i>Sagibarones</i>
pronounced judgment in the court of the Canton; and when Sigwald
the priest, and Dodilo the noble—representing respectively the
ecclesiastical and lay element, as in the association of the Bishop
with the Ealdorman in the old Anglo-Saxon Shire-gemote—sat as Missi,
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> deputies, of Hincmar in the archi-episcopal court of Rheims,
the judgment was pronounced by eight Scabini chosen from amongst
the leading Frank-tenantry of the archbishop.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> This difference
between the Roman and the Teutonic systems is even yet recognisable in
English law—all questions falling within the province of the great
official, who derives his origin from the institutions of Rome, the
Chancellor, being settled by the fiat of the royal official alone; but
whenever the freeman is put on his trial for life or liberty, his fate
is still decided by “the Jugement del Pais,” the verdict of his own
<i>Visnet</i> or neighbourhood—unless for some sufficient reason the
<i>venue</i> is changed to another <i>Visnet</i> or neighbourhood—the
presiding judge simply passing sentence according to the verdict thus
given; though in modern times the jury, and not the judge, leave the
court. Every Germanic people seems to have clung with tenacity to
this principle, and after the law of the Benefice, mostly founded on
the Roman Code, had replaced allodialism in Eastern Germany, it is
still recognizable in the stipulation that no man should be deprived
of his Benefice—for the jus Beneficiale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> had now replaced allodial
right—except “by the judgment of his peers”—the identical principle
maintained by the Anglo-Norman barons against the encroachments, not of
the Norman William, but of the Angevin Henry and his sons.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>There is not a trace of any similar institution amongst the earlier
Anglo-Saxons, as far as it is possible to judge from the collection
of laws in force in Wessex and Saxon Mercia during the reign of
Alfred. The king’s Ealdorman or his junior—the Vicarius, not the
Vicecomes—presided in the ancient Folk-mote, which was held in every
shire or district under an Ealdorman; and as every freeholder was bound
to be present at a meeting of this description, justice appears to have
been administered according to the ancient custom, in the presence
of the whole free population; though not by a Lagaman chosen by the
people, but by an official appointed by the crown. A solitary passage
in the laws of Athelstan seems to point to the exercise of judicial
functions by the “Meliores Pagenses” in the reign of Alfred’s grandson;
for in cases of manslaughter and fire-raising, if the accused was found
guilty, it was “to stand within the doom of <i>the Senior men of the
Burgh</i> whether he should have his life or not.” The principle was in
full force, during the reign of Ethelred, amongst the Anglo-Danes of
the Mercian confederacy, twelve of the Senior Thanes binding themselves
to administer true justice with the Reeve in the Gemote; unanimity in
their verdict being aimed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> by fining the dissentient minority, when
two-thirds of their number had agreed, the whole amount of the sum
which each had deposited as a <i>wed</i>—the decision of the majority
carrying the verdict, continuing to be a feature distinguishing the
Scottish from the English jury at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> No innovation
appears to have been introduced amongst the Gaelic people upon the
older custom of assembling the whole free population of the district,
confederacy, or kingdom, in annual or occasional meetings, which in the
settled parts of the country were by this time probably represented by
the assemblages of the thanedom, the earldom, and the great meeting in
which the sovereign presided in person; for it is still possible to
trace the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> existence of district, provincial, and royal judges, who
must have had a part assigned to them in each separate assemblage of
this description. Four “Courts” are alluded to in the Welsh laws, but
the free proprietary had probably little to do with the courts of the
Breyr and of the Tawg-tref—the Baron’s and the Villein Court—their
attendance being only required at the courts of the <i>Cymmud</i>
and of the king—for the earldom was unknown in Wales—where, in the
absence of the sovereign, the <i>Effeiriad</i>, the <i>Distyn</i>
and the <i>Brawddwr-Llys</i> presided; or the royal chaplain (the
equivalent perhaps of the Scandinavian <i>Hird-Bishop</i>), the
high-steward as president of all the <i>Maers</i>, and the court
judge as senior of all the <i>Cynghellwrs</i>.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> It was in a great
assembly of the whole free population of the united people that
“the laws of Aodh the Fair,” involving, probably, the right of his
descendants to the throne, were recognised in the reign of the first
Donald; a similar assemblage under Constantine the Second, on the
Moot Hill of Scone, appears to have ratified, or assented to, the
ecclesiastical constitution of the Scottish church of that period; and
it was in great meetings of a similar description, and at the same
place, that it was “the custom of the Scots” to choose their kings,
or rather perhaps to confirm the selection of their Seniors.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
The affairs of a province, or <i>Mormaordom</i>, appear to have been
regulated in a similar assemblage on a smaller scale; and a description
of such a meeting in the olden time will be found in the Registry of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> Priory of St. Andrews, part of the property of the priory having
been held by a verdict given in a general assembly of the province.
When Sir Robert Burgoin encroached upon the lands of Kirkinnis an
appeal was at once made to king David, who despatched his messengers
throughout the united district of Fife and Fotheriff to convene the
people of the province. The place of meeting is not mentioned; but
thither came Earl Constantine of Fife, “a discreet and eloquent man,”
at this time Justiciary of Scotland, with “the Satraps, Satellites,
and Hosting” of the county; or the free proprietary who held under the
Mormaor, with their kinsmen, and the followers who would have been
known amongst the Northmen as <i>Thingmen</i>. The presence of the
Bishop is not alluded to, but thither came his <i>Hosting</i>, or all
the Frank-tenantry of the broad lands restored by Alexander to the
church, under the captaincy of Budadh and Slogodadh—<i>Toshachs</i>
or leaders apparently of the military contingent due from the
church-lands in the province—and under the presidency of Macbeth,
Thane of Falkland, probably the Maor, Baillie, or <i>Vidame</i> of
the bishop. When the whole community of the province was assembled,
three arbiters were chosen to try the case,—Earl Constantine as
justiciary; Maldonaeth Mac Machedach, “a good and discreet judge,”
the <i>Brehon</i> probably of the province; and Dugal Mac Moccha, on
account of his venerable age,—the number of the arbiters exactly
coinciding with the number of judges in a Welsh court. The cause was
conducted on the principle of compurgation—in earlier times it would
have been decided by battle—the abbot in legal phrase “swearing <i>se
sexta manu</i>;” or, in other words, Abbot Dubtach and five of his
clergy testified, by an oath sworn on the altar, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> boundaries in
dispute. As no notice is taken of the defence, it is impossible to say
whether Sir Robert failed in producing his twelve compurgators—for he
would have been bound to “lay twelve hands” on the altar—or whether
the oaths of his “jury” were disbelieved; the arbiters, deferring
to Dugal from his experience and “knowledge of law,” pronounced in
favour of the Culdees; and a notice of the transaction, entered in
the Registry of the Priory of St. Andrews, attested the right of that
foundation to the property in question, as heirs of the Culdees of
Kirkinnis.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Such was the legal process, during the earlier portion of David’s
reign, for settling the numerous cases of disputed boundaries, which,
by the same king’s subsequent regulations, were decided by the
“perambulation” of the “good men and true” of the neighbourhood, and
in the presence of the royal <i>Missi</i>, or other notabilities,
appointed as “unlying witnesses” of the proceeding. There is no trace
at this period of the Vicecomes in Fifeshire, though he existed in
other quarters beyond the Forth; nor of the “Jugement del Pais,” by
which the arbiters chosen in public <i>Moot</i> were replaced by the
good men and true of the country, appointed by the royal official.
As the division of power, so remarkable amongst the Gauls in the
days of Cæsar, was still traceable in the delegation of authority to
two officials, so the restriction of all judicial functions to the
Druids would almost appear to have survived, in a certain sense, in
the limitation of similar functions to their representatives, the
Cynghellwrs, Brehons, or Deempsters. Thus the <i>Hereban</i> levied
during the reign of the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> Alexander upon all who failed to attend
the <i>Hosting</i> against Donald Mac Niel, was settled at Perth, on
the second Thursday in Lent, “by all the Judges of <i>Scotia</i>;”
condemnation was pronounced against Gillescop Mahohegan on “the
Tuesday before St. Denis” at Edinburgh, “by all the united Judges of
Galloway and Scotland;” the “Judges of Galloway” assessed the fine for
a breach of the king’s peace; and when the king crossed the borders
of a province in his great circuit, all the Judges of the district
were still bound, in the reign of William, to be in attendance upon
the royal court until it reached the frontiers of another province.
Pure blood and property qualified the Teuton to be chosen as a
<i>Scabinus</i>, but the Celtic Judge seems to have been selected from
a family of <i>Brehons</i>.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>It was probably, then, upon a system acknowledging the usual Ordeals
of water and iron, the Wager of battle, and Compurgation “by oath
sworn on the altar, according to the custom of Scotland,” and in which
justice was generally administered by the district, provincial, or
royal judge, whether inheriting his office, nominated by the crown,
or chosen as arbiter in the public <i>Moot</i>, that David introduced
the “Jugement del Pais” or <i>Visnet</i>; which must have, ere long,
replaced the judgment of the earlier Brehon, or Deempster, by the
verdict of “the good men of the country,” or the leading proprietary
of the neighbourhood. Henceforth judgment was to be given by “the
free-tenants, suitors of the Court,” sentence only being pronounced
according to their verdict by the Judge, Sheriff, Alderman, or Bailiff,
who was bound to leave the Court during their deliberation; and in
process of time, the representative of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> the ancient president of the
Gaelic Court of justice sunk so low, that the holder of the office
of Deempster, which had long been shifted upon the lowest official
of the law, no longer appeared at all in Court, except to pronounce
that sentence of death which he himself was bound to execute—he
was the <i>Hangman</i>. Every man, whether Earl, Baron, Vavassor,
or Burgess, was entitled to be tried by his Peers, though one of
lesser standing might be judged by the verdict of his superiors.
Damages, or the amount of injuries sustained, were to be assessed
by men of credit—<i>fide-digni</i>, the “unlying witnesses” of
Athelstan’s Laws; and in challenge of battle, the sum deposited was
to be estimated, not according to the claim of the challenger, but
by “the assize of the good country,” the “body of the defender”
being reckoned as one-third of the amount; whilst if a man accused
of theft could prove, to the satisfaction of a similar jury, that
the complainant had never possessed as much property as he charged
the accused with stealing, the latter was to be at once acquitted by
their verdict. Jurisdiction in the four greater causes known as “the
Crown-pleas”—murder, rape, robbery, and fire-raising—was removed
from the lesser Courts, no Alderman or Baron’s Bailiff being permitted
to try such cases unless by special mandate of the Justiciary or “his
attorney;” and it was ordered, that in every county a royal <i>Moot</i>
was to be held “within forty days,” or six week’s after the issue of
the king’s writ, which was to be attended by the Bishop, the Earl, the
Vicecomes, and by every free proprietor who was “Lord of a Vill.” All
direct appeals to the king were prohibited, except in cases connected
with the Crown-pleas, or where the officials in a lesser Court had
failed to do their duty; and if the last law, ascribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> to David, is
not misplaced, all questions connected with property and inheritance
were to be referred to the decision of “the assize of the good
country.” The heir, no longer chosen according to the Law of Tanistry,
by the kindred, was to be declared successor by the voice of “the good
men of the neighbourhood;” whilst the claimant of property held by
another—he who urged that he had been unjustly <i>disseised</i>—was
not to support his claim by an appeal to the sword, but to submit it to
the verdict of a similar jury.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The older system, however, appears
to have been reluctantly abandoned, or at any rate to have died out
very gradually; and in Galloway, which, after its closer union with
the rest of Scotland, retained its peculiar code until the days of the
first Edward and Robert Bruce, the was the exception and not the rule,
none being judged according to its provisions except they refused the
older law, and claimed <i>Visnet</i>. The Ordeal, the Wager of battle,
and the Wager of Law, long held their ground side by side with the
Verdict of the “good men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> true,” for most of the ordinary trials of
“Common Pleas;” and it seems doubtful even if in other quarters besides
Galloway it were not open to the contending parties, at a much later
period, to choose between the “Jugement del Pais,” and the misnamed
“Judgment of God.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Another of the innovations upon “ancient custom,” traceable apparently
to the reigns of Alexander and David, though more particularly to
the reign of the latter king, was the introduction of the written
charter as the necessary evidence of the right to freehold property.
It was long before any of the northern nations attached importance to
the written documents, which were at the basis of the whole system
of free rights, or property, held by Roman law. He who was freed “by
tablet” ranked merely as a Roman citizen, reckoned at half the value
of the man freed in open Court “by casting the <i>denarius</i>;” and
when the horn of the Graphio summoned the <i>Voisinage</i> around
the body of the murdered man, or when the suspended shield of the
Centenarius marked the spot where the <i>Mall</i> was to be held, the
parchment <i>writ</i> would have been unheeded by the Frank living by
Salic Law, or despised as an unmeaning formula of <i>the Roman</i>.
Liability was transferred, or responsibility was shifted, by casting
a small stick into the lap, or by throwing a handful of earth, in
open <i>Mall</i>, or before witnesses; and allodial right was alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
acquired by undisputed possession for a term of years, or by descent.
The earliest application of the Roman principle appears in the royal
grant equivalent to the Franc-Alleu-noble—the permanent alienation
of a certain portion of the Fiscal or Folk-land, in which, by ancient
custom, the king, or the community, held a life interest alone: a
similar process, some centuries later, converting the Benefice into
the hereditary Feud, held by written charter. The royal grant of
<i>Bocland</i> had long been familiar to the Anglo-Saxons as the sole
known form of permanent property; but the Benefice, rather than the
chartered Feud, was its equivalent amongst the Normans in the earlier
part of the eleventh century; and when they adopted the Charter after
the Conquest, it was always in the old Anglo-Saxon form, which can
scarcely be supposed to have been brought from the Continental Duchy;
and it was accordingly in this form that it penetrated subsequently
into Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>It is only from indirect evidence that it can be gathered that the
Charter became necessary, to prove the existence of freehold right,
from the time of David. The charters ascribed to Duncan II., and Edgar,
were connected with the Saxon Church of Durham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> They were attested,
apparently, by witnesses of Saxon, or Danish, descent, connected
probably with the diocese—Ligulf of Bamborough, for example—and drawn
up by Saxon monks after the manner of their own country; so that they
afford no proof whatever of the existence, or the necessity, of public,
much less of private, documents of this description beyond the Forth
at the opening of the twelfth century; and when Alexander restored
to the Church the lands which had lapsed to the kings of Scotland,
as hereditary abbots of St. Andrews, the re-grant was completed with
all the studied ceremonial and display of “ancient custom.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> A
different course, indeed, was adopted at Scone; when, for the first
time, perhaps, was displayed the unwonted spectacle of six Gaelic
Mormaors affixing crosses to the signatures, which some clerkly scribe
had attached to a written document,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> confirming a munificent donation
of lands and privileges to the royal foundation: but no private
charters can be traced to an earlier date than the reign of David, who
appears to have first introduced them into his principality of Scottish
Cumbria. No law or enactment of any description has been left on the
subject; but a statute of William, by which all who were found guilty
of forging a royal charter were to be placed “at the king’s mercy”—the
forgery of a similar grant from a subject being also punishable, but
as a minor offence—affords the surest evidence of the necessity of a
charter, at that period, in proof of freehold rights.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The habit
of forging such evidence must have arisen out of the necessity of a
written title-deed, a similar necessity accounting for the multiplicity
of such forgeries in southern Britain; where a legend was occasionally
framed for a similar purpose, or a saint appeared in a vision to afford
miraculous, but suspicious, testimony about the extent and privileges
of his ancient patrimony. Henceforth the Charter marked the Freeholder,
or the member of the Community of the Realm; and whilst in southern
Britain knight-service was the test of gentle birth, the holder by
free socage, and the Kentish Gaveller, being only classed amongst the
yeomanry, in Scotland a similar test was afforded by the Charter; and
in the reign of Alexander II., all who were knights, sons of knights,
or holders of any portion of a knight’s fee, and all who held their
lands by free service, or by “fie-de-hauberc,” hereditarily and by
charter, ranked, with their sons, as men of free and gentle birth, who
could appear in the lists by their champion; the churl-born tenant of
land, the man of ignoble birth, and all who had neither free tenement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
nor free parentage, being bound to appear in person. It was from the
former class that the “good men and true” were chosen to perform the
duties of the <i>Voisinage</i>, and before the middle of the thirteenth
century none could be sworn to hold inquest touching “the life or limbs
of a land or <i>grass</i> holding man,” except, “good men and true,
freeholders by charter.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>It can scarcely, then, be doubted that David was the originator of
that important change by which a fixed title to land was acquired,
produceable when necessary in proof of ownership—a change which, in
connection with the formal perambulation of boundaries, in the presence
of “the good men and true,” must have done much to put a stop to
those constant disputes about proprietorship, which had hitherto been
settled by the sword. David is often represented, in modern times, as
the exterminator of his fellow-countrymen, granting their lands to
foreigners, and driving out the native Scottish race, or enslaving them
beneath the yoke of alien masters—a course that could have hardly
earned the character ascribed to him by his friend and biographer
Ailred, “he was beloved by his own people the Scots, and feared by the
men of Galloway.” It would be nearer the truth, perhaps, to describe
him as the great confirmer of proprietary right throughout the settled
portion of his kingdom; and it still seems possible to point out the
method which was adopted to carry out his purpose. By a law of a much
later period it was decided that the freeholder was not bound to
produce his charter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> his overlord more than once, after which it
was to be returned to him immediately. It may be gathered, from this
regulation, that there were occasions on which the land-holder might be
required to prove his title to ownership; and the kings of Scotland,
at a later period, are sometimes found amongst the Western Highlands
demanding charters, and confiscating the property, or rather the
freehold rights, of all who could not produce the necessary title-deed.
Thus, at the opening of the fourteenth century, every Vicecomes was
commanded to attend “our council,” with the other magnates of the
realm, and to warn his bailies, amongst other duties, “to summon all
who have, without license, entered upon lands alienated after the death
of our predecessor Alexander, to show their right to do so”—a right
which could only be proved by a written document. How such a title
was originally acquired may be gathered from the example of Eogan,
Thane of Rothenec, who appeared at Inverness on the Monday before St.
Andrew’s Day, in the year 1262, and in the presence of the Bishop of
Ross, the Justiciary of Scotland, and the Sheriff of Elgin, proved to
the satisfaction of the good men and true of the neighbourhood, that
the lands of Mefth, with a house in Elgin Castle, which had been given
by William to Yothre Mac Gillies, had been held uninterruptedly by
Eogan and Angus, son and grandson of the first recipient of the grant;
passing from the last-named Angus to his son Eogan, the actual Thane
of Rothenec, who was thus the fourth in descent from the original
holder. The written and attested verdict of the good men and true,
formed, from this time forward, the chartered title-deed of the lands
of Mefth; and it may be conjectured that, at the first introduction of
the Charter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> all who claimed the right of freehold proprietorship were
bound to attend the royal <i>Moot</i>, and prove to the satisfaction of
the good men and true, the necessary qualification of three descents
of ownership. He who was thus qualified could claim a charter as his
title from the king, earl, thane, or ecclesiastical superior, of whom
he held his lands; whilst in the case of all who failed in proving
the necessary qualification, it would remain in the power of their
overlord, either to confirm their proprietorship by the wished-for
title, or to enter upon the land as lapsed “demesne.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>From this period two classes of Freeholders, besides the Earls and
greater Barons, may be traced in Scotland, who may be compared
to the Vavassors or Mesné tenants of the corresponding era in
Southern Britain; the holders by knight-service, who grew into the
<i>Lairds</i>, or lesser Barons, of a later age; and the holders by
Scottish service, who were, with few exceptions, confined to the
northward of the Forth.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The latter were the Thanes, who, on the
occasion of the festivities at York in 1251, when Paris notices the
presence of more than sixty Scottish knights, were also in attendance
upon their youthful sovereign, at least in equal numbers.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The
lowest amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> Freeholders appears to have been the proprietor of
half a plough-land—the eighth part of a <i>Davoch</i> or of a <i>Fief
de Hauberk</i>—containing fifty-two Scottish acres; the holder of
that amount of land, by free service, and by charter, answering to
the proprietor of the Half-holding, wherever the Imperial Law of the
Benefice was acknowledged, who, though widely changed in character, is
still known in the United Kingdom as “the forty shilling freeholder.”
The Quarter-holding of two <i>ox-gangs</i>, or twenty-six Scottish
acres, answering to the Anglo-Saxon <i>Virgate</i> or quarter-hyde,
and known in many parts of Scotland as the <i>Husband-land</i>, gave
no pretensions originally to freehold rights.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Scottish service
was probably most popular in early times with the native Scots, for it
accorded best with their custom of planting the junior branches of the
family upon the land, liable to rent, as well as to general military
service—a system which may have also had its attractions in the eyes
of the greater Barons, who held their own lands by knight-service of
the Crown—but it died out gradually in the more settled portions of
the kingdom; and, in the case of certain well-known families, the
charters can still be produced by which the ancestral Thanedom was
converted into a Barony. The earlier system was traceable in the
Highlands as late as the opening of the seventeenth century, when
the proprietors were divided into Lords, Lairds—greater and lesser
Barons—and royal Bailies of lands, the latter holding in fee-farm,
and answering to the Thanes of an earlier period.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The patronymic,
as distinguished from the surname, still lingered in the same quarter,
where the <i>Tighern</i> was known for his descent, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> than from
his property, though the custom was even then fast giving way; and at
the present time, in no part of the United Kingdom is the territorial
appellation so generally used as in the Scottish Highlands, where
“the Laird” is often better known by the name of his property than
by his own surname. A similar change had been in progress in ancient
<i>Scotia</i> long before it penetrated to the wilds of <i>Moravia</i>
and Argyle; and after the introduction of the charter, when the
privileges of free and gentle birth, hitherto attached to a certain
degree of relationship to a thane, were transferred to the chartered
freehold, the freeholder, whether of native or foreign origin,
gradually became known from his barony or freehold; and as none but the
greater Norman barons were distinguished, as at present, by a separate
surname, the property itself supplied a designation for its owner. Thus
by degrees the whole of the freehold proprietary, without distinction
of race, relinquishing the shifting patronymic which had hitherto
belonged as much to the Saxon and the Northman as to the Gael, adopted
surnames from those chartered properties, which ensured to them the
privileges of free and gentle birth, which had formerly attached to
descent.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>If David may be looked upon as the regulator of the “Two Estates,”—the
Clergy, and the Baronage and Freeholders connected with the land,—he
may be regarded as the founder of the “Third Estate” in Scotland, the
actual creator of the free population<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> connected with the towns. An
intramural population was an anomaly amongst the people of the North,
and in their older codes no provision was made for a free proprietary
dwelling in towns, land, and land only, being connected with freedom
and hereditary right. It is only in the old Burgundian code that the
craftsman connected with the city is mentioned, and he was placed by
the regulations of Gundobald upon a servile footing. It scarcely admits
of a doubt, indeed, that a civic population, for which no provision was
made in any Germanic code, must have lived, whether free or servile, by
Roman law, retaining probably their original institutions, after they
survived the first fury of the storm, without much interference from
their conquerors; nor would the privileges subsequently belonging to
free towns have been of much moment, had there not been a time when all
such communities were neither free nor privileged. Britain, however,
was peculiarly situated, no Roman population remaining to preserve
the civilized institutions of imperial despotism, side by side with
the rude, but free, traditions of their Anglo-Saxon conquerors—most
fortunately for the liberties of England—and as no regulations for a
free civic proprietary are traceable in the earlier Anglo-Saxon laws,
it may be doubted whether any such proprietary existed. The shattered
remnants of the old Roman cities of the island became the property of
the owners of the district in which they were situated—petty kings
and Ealdormen originally, like Hrofa and Cissa, who gave their names
to Hrofa’s <i>ceaster</i> and Cissa’s <i>ceaster</i>, <i>Rochester</i>
and <i>Chichester</i>; and latterly the sovereign of one of the
greater states, or the nobleman to whom he entrusted the district—the
population remaining probably on a <i>Lœtic</i> or dependant footing,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> Teutonic element entering very little into its composition in
early times. The British <i>town</i>, according to Cæsar, was a
portion of the forest separated from the rest by a bank and ditch, the
Briton in time of danger securing his cattle and family within the
precincts of this “circumvallation;” and as amongst several of the
Germanic tribes the same word <i>Wic</i> meant <i>a grove</i>, <i>a
temple</i>, and <i>a town</i>, it may be surmised that the original
<i>Wick</i> was a portion of the forest similarly encircled with a
bank and ditch, and used as a temple for the gods, and a place of
security in times of danger, instead of the caves which, in the days
of Tacitus, appear to have been used, for places of concealment rather
than for defence. London-<i>wic</i> and other British towns may have
occasionally supplied the place of such earlier and ruder “places of
strength,” the resident population remaining on a dependant footing,
and the freeholders of the vicinity not habitually dwelling within the
walls, but sheltering themselves behind them in times of danger; for
the <i>Tun</i> of the Gesithcundman was scarcely capable of defence,
and the Ceorl’s <i>Hedge</i> was only calculated to keep out cattle.
Such seems to have been the case at the time of the Danish wars,
when the walls were seldom of a more formidable construction than a
strong wooden palisade, and were easily broken through at the great
battle of York. As soon as he had saved the monarchy, Alfred directed
his attention, as much to remedying this defect, as to reviving
letters amongst his subjects, or building ships to protect the coast,
constantly impressing the necessity of building <i>Burhs</i> upon his
Reeves and Ealdormen, and providing skilled artificers—a sure test of
the ignorance of such arts amongst his own people—to carry out his
projects. London-<i>wic</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> plundered and ruined by the Danes, arose
from its ashes as London-<i>burh</i>, and was made over—<i>geset</i>
or let—by Alfred to his daughter’s husband, the Mercian Ealdorman. The
history of the next reign, after Edward was once securely seated on his
throne, is one continual record of the progress of <i>Burh</i>-building
and <i>Hlaford-socn</i>—or Commendation—the <i>Burh-bote</i>, a
permanent obligation attached to all property held of the crown,
whether church-land or thegn-land, binding the churchman or thegn to
keep in repair the <i>Burh</i> with which his land was connected, such
associations being entered into for defence, not for trade; and it
would be a grave error to mistake the Anglo-Danish confederacy of “the
Five Burghs,” or the men of London-Burgh in the days of Athelstane—the
<i>Burh-Thegns</i> as they are often called—whose Bishops and Reeves
were bound to keep the peace, as ordered by the king and his Witan, for
mercantile or trading communities. The rules laid down by the London
Reeves and Bishops at this period will be found to relate to tracing
stolen cattle, and keeping their “Hirdmen” in order; but it is vain
to look for the regulations about trades and craftsmen, which will be
found invariably in later Burghal laws.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>Amongst the innovations introduced by the Normans, it may be read in
the Saxon Chronicle how “they wrought castles throughout the land,”
novelties to the people of the country, who seem to have retained
much of that old Germanic aversion to castles which is traceable in
the Frison law against building stone walls above a certain height;
and accordingly from this time the Scots no longer swept the country
in their invasions to the gates of Durham, but were stopped at Werk,
Norham, and other feudal strongholds which they were obliged to invest,
or if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> they advanced further into the country, to blockade. The royal
castle was now attached to the royal burgh, and its garrison provided
by the knights who held their lands by the tenure of castle-guard; the
neighbouring gentry probably, differing little from the thegns who in
earlier times had been bound to keep the burgh in repair. The name of
Burgher henceforth undoubtedly belonged only to the actual possessors
of property within the walls, the bulk of whom had probably from the
earliest period of their location within burgh formed the commercial
part—the Twyhyndmen, as the Upland thegns were the Twelfhyndmen—of
the community. It was the Anglo-Norman Burgh, with its feudal castle,
and its civic population distinct and separate from the garrison,
which was the model of the burghs established, or confirmed, by David
beyond the Tweed. It may be doubted whether any free communities
engaged in commerce, and occupying walled towns, were in existence
much before this reign even in the Lothians, though the germs of such
societies may have existed at Scone, Edinburgh, Stirling, and other
places, which were of a certain importance at that early period. Had
there been burghs or walled towns in any part of Saxon Northumbria
before the close of the eleventh century, the invading Scots would
have surely been checked before they reached the gates of Durham;
the unopposed incursion of the Second Constantine as far as the Tees
marking apparently the non-existence, in that quarter, of any walled
town in the middle of the tenth century, capable of arresting the
progress of a hostile force. As the sees of Glasgow and St. Andrews
may be regarded as the models left by David for the regulation of the
other Scottish bishoprics, so the <i>Hanse</i> or community of the
Four Burghs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> Roxburgh, Berwick, Edinburgh, and Stirling, was the
leading commercial association of the same reign, all other burghs as
they grew into existence conforming to its rules and ordinances; and as
the <i>Hanse</i> was composed of four burghs, so each Burgh seems to
have been originally divided into four Wards—in strict accordance with
the theory which divided in a similar way the great rural association
of the shire into four quarters. Over every Ward was placed a Bailie,
a type of the rural “Mair of the Quarter,” and sometimes known, like
the President of the Frison Quarter, as the <i>Ferthyngman</i>; the
leading personage being the Burgh-Reeve, or Provost, annually chosen,
with the Bailies and Bedells, by the community of the Burghers in the
first Burgh-Moot held after Michaelmas.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Complete self-government,
indeed, was conferred, from the outset, upon the Scottish Burghers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
by a sovereign who was desirous of attracting such a class to his
kingdom; and the enlightened policy of David, together with the state
of peace and prosperity which he secured for the whole of the North
of England, as well as for the settled portion of his own kingdom,
soon filled the walled towns, which rapidly sprung up on every side,
with a crowd of willing settlers from Southern Britain and Flanders,
who were guaranteed the enjoyment of even more than the usual freedom
and privileges under the royal protection. They were to be judged
by their own chosen magistrates, by “the verdict of their peers”—a
privilege shared, indeed, with every Scottish freeholder—and according
to the laws and assize of the Burgh, sanctioned by the community, and
regulated by the Provost and twelve leading men. As in the case of the
Baron’s Court, the crown pleas were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of
the Provost and Bailies, but the royal justiciary, or his deputy, sat
in the Burgh-Court; the verdict was given by the “good men and true”
of the community; and no summons made by a royal serjeant was valid,
unless he was accompanied by the Town Bedell. Every burgher was bound
to possess at least one rood of land in the burgh, for which he paid
five pence yearly to the king; and to swear fealty to the sovereign,
the magistrates, and the community of the burgh—for the tie which
bound the burgher was the old fealty of the <i>Leud</i>, not the homage
of the <i>Antrustion</i> with its attendant obligations; he plighted
his troth with his hand upon the Sacred Volume, not placed between
the hands of his overlord “after the Frank custom.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> In this, and in
other points, burgage-tenure much resembled the tenures of socage, and
of gavelkind, which approached the earlier allodial custom, looked
upon in later times as <i>Roturier</i>; but from Merchet, Heriot,
and other exactions which had passed, with the principles of service
and dependance, into many of the tenures of the age, the Scottish
Burgher was exempt; as well as from the wardship which was attached to
knight-service. The heir, if a minor, remained with his “chattels” in
the custody of his mother’s relatives, the father’s kindred taking the
charge of the “heritage;” this heritage being strictly entailed upon
the heir, who could stop those deathbed transfers of property which
were occasionally suggested by designing personages, whether lay or
clerical. Under certain circumstances, such as the fear of starvation,
even the Allod might be parted with; and similarly the “Capital
Messuage” might be sold, or the property alienated, if the heir was
either unwilling, or unable, to relieve his father’s necessities, or
to pay his father’s debts; the Burghal Code justifying this exception
from the ordinary rule by the admission that “nede has na law.” Twelve
witnesses were required for the purchase of a burgage tenement, the
twelve next door neighbours apparently, who stood in the place of the
kindred of earlier times—the occupants of the four houses on either
side and of the four immediately opposite; and if the tenement was held
without dispute for a year and a day—the period which also seems,
from time immemorial, to have conferred the right of participating
in the privileges of “the neighbourhood” in the rural districts—it
became the absolute property of the purchaser, unless the former
owner could show that he was a minor, or beyond sea, at the time of
the purchase. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> perfect freedom of burgage tenure was ensured by
the provision that “If any man’s <i>thryll</i>, baron’s or knight’s,
comes to the burgh and buys a burgage, and dwells in his burgage a
twelvemonth and a day, without challenge of his lord or his baillie,
he shall be ever more free as a burgess within that king’s burgh, and
enjoy the freedom of that burgh;” an enactment, not so much aimed at
encouraging fugitive native-men from the rural districts to settle in
the towns, as against a previous state of society which still exists in
Russia—or existed lately—in which the bondman might rise to wealth
and station as a citizen, without shaking off the thraldom which bound
him to his original proprietor. As, after the enfranchisement of towns,
the undisputed possession of a burgage tenement for a year and a day
conferred the proprietorship of a freehold, it necessarily carried with
it, like the gift of arms at an earlier period, the indisputable rights
of a freeholder.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Every fortnight a <i>Moot</i> was held within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> burgh, at which
every burgher within the walls was bound to be present—in winter,
before <i>Undern</i>, or nine o’clock in the morning; and at
<i>Midmorn</i> during the summer—a greater Burgh-moot being assembled
at Michaelmas, Christmas, and Easter, at which the presence of every
upland burgher was also required, their absence being punished by
the highest fine levied—the full forfeiture—as the burgher who
dwelt without the walls was excused attendance upon the lesser moots.
The general Burgh-moot was evidently a relic of the time before the
separation of the Castle from the Burgh, when the upland thegns
were bound, under heavy penalty, to meet three times a-year to
fulfil the duties of their tenure; the lesser moots, and the general
regulations of the burgh having been probably left very much to the
<i>Twyhyndmen</i> who dwelt within the walls. A watch was established
for the security of the town; and at the stroke of a staff upon the
door, an inmate was bound to come forth from every burgher’s house,
and, armed with two weapons, to join in keeping watch and ward over the
sleeping burgh from <i>couvre-feu</i> to <i>cockcrow</i>, the houses
of widows alone being exempted from this duty. The trades were under
the general superintendence of the <i>Probi homines</i>, or leading
men of the burgh, and some of their regulations are remarkable. The
baker whose bread was not made and placed openly, in the window, for
sale, was fined “full forfeiture,” and his bread confiscated for
the use of the poor—a somewhat questionable method of disposing of
it, if the law was to punish its adulteration. The provision dealer
was obliged to sell all that was in his house beyond the value of
fourpence, if required, on the plea that it was public property—an
enactment levelled, probably, against hoarding provisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> in a time
of scarcity for private use, or for profit; for when famines were
of frequent occurrence, the dealer in the necessaries of life might
be tempted to speculate in his neighbours need. The dignity of the
magistracy was kept up by prohibiting any Provost, Bailie, or Bedell,
from making bread, or brewing ale, for sale; and of the burgherhood,
by excluding from its privileges every dyer, butcher, or tanner, who
worked at his calling with his own hands. If he aspired to become a
member of the guild, the business was to be deputed to other hands,
whom he was only to superintend as “a master.” Cloth appears to have
been the staple product of the time, and wool was as jealously guarded
as in England, none but a burgher being allowed to buy it, for the
purposes of dying, or cloth-making. An occasional difficulty with “the
hands,” as at present, appears to have arisen, though from different
causes; but the age was less scrupulous, and the <i>Kemester</i>,
or wool-comber, who tried to escape to the Upland, might at once be
committed to the town-jail, on the plea that there was work to be done.
The runaway was not invariably a fugitive from the rural districts.
It was a hard age for the dependant classes wherever they were; and
the “bondman in-burgh” may at times have cast many a wistful glance
towards the blue hills in the distance. Monopoly and exclusive dealing
were only in accordance with the spirit and policy of the age; and must
inevitably have arisen in every quarter, when it was enacted that every
sale and purchase should be made “in port,” and in the presence of
witnesses chosen “in burgh;” which must, of course, have concentrated
all the traffic of the district connected with the burgh in the hands
of the resident population. The subdivision of the Hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> was unknown
in Scotland, and accordingly such privileges occasionally extended
over the whole County or Sheriffdom; as in Edinburgh, and as in the
case of Perth; where, perhaps in consequence of this wide monopoly,
the unprivileged trader from other quarters was allowed to retail
cloth during the summer, from Ascension Day to the 1st of August;
though ordinarily the privileges of the burgh were only suspended
during Fair-time. The Fair was in some respects a sort of regulated
Saturnalia; none but the outlaw, the traitor, and the malefactor whose
crime was of too deep a dye to admit of sanctuary, could be taken
during its continuance; all else, whether debtors, runaways, or minor
offenders of any description, being free from arrest, except they broke
“the peace of the Fair,” when they were tried and punished, not by the
ordinary magistrates of the burgh, but in a temporary Court, known
universally as the Court of <i>Pies-poudrees</i>, or <i>Dusty-feet</i>.
The Dustyfoot was the travelling pedlar, or merchant as he was called
in Scotland, the original of the modern Haberdasher—or “man with a
<i>Havresac</i>;” and as, in Fair-time, the <i>Stallenger</i>, or
trader who sold from a temporary stall, or booth, could claim “<i>lot
and cavyl</i>”—share and share—with the more dignified Burgher, with
whom for the time he was upon an equality, it would have been contrary
to the true northern principle of justice if he had been liable to be
tried and punished in a strange Court, and by any other verdict than
that of “his Peers,” the Community, for the time being, of the Fair.
The Dustyfoot probably came by land, and only entered the burgh for
traffic during Fair-time; but the sea, or the river, bore the vessel of
the foreign trader to the burgh at all times, though, except when it
was otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> provided, as at Perth during summer time, the burghers
alone could dispose of the traders’ wares, only salt or herrings being
sold on board ship. All disputes between a foreign trader and a burgher
were to be settled before the third flood of the tide.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>No Burgh was complete without a Hospital—no royal Burgh without a
Castle. Leprosy was the disease of the age—a never-ceasing plague,
entailed by unwholesome food, a want of vegetables, and the salted meat
and fish, which formed invariably the winter diet, not a little aided
by uncleanliness. Every one struck with leprosy within the walls was
to be removed at once to the <i>Spittal</i>; and if he had nothing of
his own, a collection of twenty shillings—a considerable sum for the
time—was to be raised for his support. If the pauper was not cured by
the time the money was spent, he was probably dismissed as incurable,
and classed amongst the confirmed lepers, who were forbidden to enter
any town, but were allowed to sit at the gate and beg. By the Law of
Scotland it was allowable to give “Herbary” to a stranger for one night
without question, but if he stayed beyond that period the host was
answerable for the guest, and bound to produce him before the proper
officer. Even this relic of the unstinted hospitality of early times
was dispensed with in the case of this dreaded disease; and he who
sheltered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> a leper within the walls was liable to the heaviest fine
inflicted, “the full forfeiture.” Similar arrangements were once in
force in every burgh; as in London, for instance, where the <i>Spittal
Fields</i> were the open meadows around the Hospital for Lepers, who
were allowed to ask for alms at the <i>Cripples Gate</i>, a spot which
the charitable may have sought out, but which a larger class must, most
assuredly, have shunned.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>The royal burgh was under the rule of its chosen magistrates, but the
royal castle was under the charge of the Constable appointed by the
king, this office often becoming hereditary in the family on which
it was originally conferred. Forty days were fixed as the period of
service on castle-guard, which, like everything else towards the
decline of the Feudal system, was gradually compounded for by a money
payment to the Constable; who, in other words, performed the service
with his own retainers, and exacted the usual fine, or its equivalent,
for the non-attendance of the party bound by the tenure of his land to
undertake such service. This custom, however, had scarcely grown into
general use in the reign of David, for it was one of the provisions
of Magna Charta that no Constable should summon a knight to perform
castle-guard whilst he was serving in the king’s army, nor exact the
fine for non-attendance when he was ready to perform the service in
person, or by proper substitute. Freedom from arrest was one of the
privileges attached to castle-guard, as well as to service in the
king’s “host,” lasting, like the similar privilege of Parliament, which
still exists, for the whole period of service; the same exemption being
extended to all who were in attendance on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span> duties in the county,
or who were sent to the burgh to buy provisions for their lord. The
Bailie of the castle was empowered to borrow of a burgher goods to the
amount of forty pence, and for a period not exceeding forty days; but
it was at the option of the lender to increase the amount of the loan
beyond that sum, or to defer the time of payment beyond the forty days.
At Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, a “castellan” was entitled to
demand from a burgher pigs, geese, or chickens, “for the king’s need;”
but if the burgher could close his door no entry might be forced—his
house was his castle, according to the well-known English saying—but
the castellan might catch and kill any of the burgher’s stock that
he found beyond bounds, paying the price at which the neighbourhood
assessed the articles. The probable object of both these regulations
was to ensure the garrison a fair supply of necessaries without
entailing too heavy a burden upon the townsmen. In all disputes, if
a castellan complained of wrong, he was to claim his right in the
Court of the Burgh; and if the burgher considered himself aggrieved he
was to carry his plaint to the Castle gate. On these occasions there
appears to have been a mixed jury, as in the trial of an alien at the
present day, “the peers” of each party furnishing a portion; such at
least seems to have been the case in the following trial in the castle
of Dumfries for the homicide of a burgher, the party charged with the
offence being an Upland-man, probably on castle-guard, as he was tried
in the place appointed for appeals against a castellan. Adam, the
miller of Dumfries, meeting Richard, son of Robert Elias’s son, in the
churchyard of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian in the castle, abused him as
a thief, “because he was a Galloway man”—a species of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> reasoning still
sometimes current in cases of unpopular nationality. On the following
Thursday, when Adam was standing in the doorway of a house, a woman
called out to him that Richard was coming up the street, warning him
to be on his guard. “My knife is as sharp as his,” replied the miller;
attacking Richard at once, who drew his sword and struck Adam with the
flat side of the weapon. The miller closed his arm upon the sword, and
in disengaging it sharply, Richard inflicted a mortal wound upon his
assailant, exclaiming, on seeing the catastrophe, “you caused your own
death.” All the Burghers testified on oath that Richard was a man of
good repute, but that Adam was a rogue; and the “Barons” concurring, an
unanimous verdict of acquittal was pronounced. Barons and Burghers both
seem to have been concerned in this trial, which affords a very fair
specimen of the lawless manners of the age, and of the advantages of
the “jugement del pais” over the earlier system expressed in the legal
axiom “buy the spear or bear it”—pay the <i>were</i> or stand the
feud.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Such were the leading regulations of David’s community of Burghs. They
correspond closely with the ancient customs of Newcastle, to which
indeed allusion is made in the Burghal Code, the English community
having been consulted apparently upon the law of inheritance;<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and
there can be little doubt that the Anglo-Norman Burgh, itself in most
respects a confirmation of the Anglo-Saxon, except where the custom
of Borough-English existed, was the model for the burghs introduced
by David throughout the land. In imitation of their sovereign, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
greater magnates, lay and ecclesiastical, occasionally enfranchised
their towns, or founded burghs, filling them with a class of freemen
on a footing with the royal burghers, though the latter were reckoned
higher in the social scale, and were privileged to decline the
challenge of a member of a lesser burgh; just as the <i>Scepenbar</i>
man, who could count his “four ancestors and his <i>hant-gemahl</i>,”
was entitled to refuse the challenge of his equal in position who
was not his equal in blood.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The royal burghs generally retained
their ascendancy, though not invariably; for in spite of the jealous
rivalry of Dunbarton and Rutherglen, upon the margin of her own fair
river, the great episcopal city of Glasgow has long been acknowledged
the undisputed mistress of the western waters. The original burghers,
as a class, were, with few exceptions, of foreign origin, emigrants
from southern Britain, and not unfrequently Flemings; as in Berwick,
where the Flemings long dwelt apart as a separate guild.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It was
long before the native element entered largely amongst the privileged
civic population, clinging to Scottish customs and to the rural
districts, especially in the distant North, where the towns must have
long stood out like commercial garrisons in a disaffected, and not
unfrequently a hostile, country. Not the least amongst the many changes
introduced by the burgher class beyond the Forth was the diffusion of
the language hitherto only spoken to the southward of that river, a
Teutonic dialect spreading over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> country, as in Ireland, with the
gradual preponderance of the intramural population, a similar result
being traceable in France, though under exactly opposite circumstances;
for the language spoken in towns, where men congregate together in
large numbers, will always prevail over the dialects of a rural and
scattered population. It would be difficult to overestimate the utility
of the burgher class to the Scotland of that period, or its influence
in promoting the amelioration and prosperity of the country. The
increase it brought to the revenue, though perhaps one of its greatest
advantages in the opinion of the age, was comparatively of secondary
importance. The invariable tendency of such a class has always been
to favour peace, order, and civilization, as long as it has occupied
its natural position; for it is only when a burgherhood has become
over-powerful that it has afforded as frequent examples as a nobility,
or an <i>autocracy</i>, of the inability of human nature in any
condition to withstand the evil influences of unlimited power. Such was
not the case in Britain, where the burgherhood has never occupied the
same position as the great communities of Flanders, of Germany, or of
Northern Italy. It would be of little use to speculate upon what might
have happened had England remained under the rule of a feeble, or an
“unkindly” king—of Edgar Atheling or Harold—with her great provincial
<i>Jarls</i>, like the Dukes of Franee, distracting the country with
their contentions for power. Great burgher communities might have
arisen, especially in the Danelage, where the Socmen, representatives
of the <i>Land-agende</i> men, or Odal-Bonders, of an earlier period,
were exactly the class to form a martial burgherhood; but such a future
was not to be. In neither England nor Scotland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span> has the civic class
ever been the sole depositary of the ancient northern principles of
self-government, as on the Continent; where the <i>Echevin</i>, the
representative of the ancient <i>Scepenbar</i> Freeholder, who could
alone pass judgment upon his equal, has for centuries been confined
to the towns. It may be read in the Capitularies of the Carlovingian
era, how it was offered to the ancestry of the French nobility to
declare the law they would live by, and their choice was destined to
be unfortunate; for wherever the hand of Imperial Rome is traceable,
it has sown the seeds of future despotism. In every part of Britain,
however, there was but one law for Baron and for Burgher, framed upon
the principles of the free north; and much as we may be indebted to
the civic portion of our “Third Estate,” the institutions of which
we are so justly proud, were not preserved by their intervention.
It is well that in the days of old there were other parties engaged
in the struggle; for where is the example that history can furnish
of a contest for liberty successfully carried out by an unassisted
Burgherhood?<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The Court was not forgotten in the reforming zeal of David, and
following up the innovations, which seem to have been first introduced
by Alexander,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span> he assimilated the Scottish Court to the Anglo-Norman
model, with which both brothers must have been familiar. It must not
be supposed, however, that before this period a Court was unknown in
Scotland; but it was probably of a primitive character, even after
the innovations of Queen Margaret. Howel Dha is supposed to have laid
down certain regulations, about the middle of the tenth century,
for his Court in Wales; and without putting faith in the apocryphal
ordinances ascribed to Malcolm the Second, it may be safely assumed
that Scotland, in the eleventh century, was at least as far advanced
in this respect as Wales in the tenth. Fordun, who gives to Crinan the
title of Abthane of Dull and Seneschal of the Isles, describes the
Abthane as the Head of all the royal Thanes; and though the title is
evidently an error, the office may have been a reality, for it would
have been simply identical with that of the Welsh Distyn, the Lord
High Steward or Seneschal. In every Scottish Earldom the Seneschal was
next in authority to the Earl—his Deputy or Maor, who appeared in his
place at the greater Shire Moots appointed by William; and Crinan may
have filled such an office under the king. The feature most worthy
of remark, however, in the constitution of the Welsh Court, was the
rank and position of the royal attendants, the highest alone—the
Distyn—being on a footing with the Chief, and the royal officials of
the Commot; while only the leading Court officials were on a level with
the Breyr, or noble proprietor; and the other members of the household
ranked only just above the Boneddig, or Lesser Freeman. Dignity of the
highest description, therefore, was not attached at this period to
service about the royal person; and the classes from which the Welsh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
king chose his courtiers and attendants were the lesser freemen, and
the dependants known as <i>Mab aillts</i>, rather than the noble class
which furnished the Maors and Cynghellwrs.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>It must not be imagined that this was a Welsh or a Celtic peculiarity,
for there was a time when the <i>Hird</i>, or Court, of the Frank kings
was of a yet more primitive description, the attendants in the Hird
being all on a servile footing, known as <i>Scalcs</i>, and chosen most
probably from the subordinate race. The Household appears to have been
under the superintendence of the <i>Sene-scalc</i>—perhaps the Senior
Slave—the Stable under the <i>March-scalc</i>, officials who seem
to be traceable amongst the Anglo-Saxons in the <i>Wealh-gerefa</i>
and the royal <i>Horswealh</i>, the latter raised by his office to
the footing of a <i>Ceorl</i>.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Totally unconnected with the
servile classes, and in the absence of the sovereign exercising royal
authority over the whole kingdom, as well as over the Household, was
the Deputy, the “Dux et Major Domus regni Francorum,” more familiarly
known as the <i>Maire du Palais</i>, whose original Teutonic title was
probably the <i>Stallr</i>. The office was originally elective, the
Franks choosing the Deputy as well as the actual sovereign; and it
must in some respects have resembled that of the Celtic <i>Tascio</i>.
It latterly became hereditary, as is well known, in the family of
Pepin and Charles Martel, who monopolized the office in Austrasia and
Neustrasia, until they exchanged the title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> of Maire du Palais for
that of king. No other great official besides the Stallr is traceable
in the Norwegian Court, for which, at the opening of the eleventh
century, Olive the Saint framed regulations, which must have been
adopted for the usages of other Courts of the same period; though the
use of the word <i>Hus-Carles</i>, both there and in England, may point
to the gradual replacement of the <i>scalc</i> by the freeman about
the royal person. The progress of Roman innovation soon necessitated
the presence of officials whom the simpler institutions of the north
ignored; and to receive the offerings of the fiscal tenantry, made in
lieu of the <i>feorm</i>, <i>veitzslo</i> or actual support afforded to
the sovereign and his retinue, a <i>Camera</i>, or treasure-chamber,
was required; the leading <i>Camerarius</i>, or Chamberlain, the Lord
High Treasurer of the age, becoming, as purse-bearer, a most important
member of the Court. The charter next became a necessary document
to attest the possession of proprietary right; and accordingly, in
the early part of the ninth century, it was ordered in the Frank
Capitularies, “that there should be chosen everywhere good and true
Chancellors, to write public charters before the Comes, Scabini,
and Vicarii.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Much more, then, was it necessary that a similar
official should be in attendance at the fountain-head of all chartered
grants, and consequently the royal <i>Cancellarius</i> became another
most important attendant upon the royal person, the clerkly attributes
required for the Chancellorship naturally placing it in the hands of
the clergy. Most of these changes were probably introduced amongst
the Franks after their king had been converted into the <i>Kaiser</i>
of the West; and as the old Allodial Stallr disappeared with the
institutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span> of which he was a part, the office, which raised a
subject to such a dangerous proximity to the throne, seems to have been
divided between his subordinates. His leadership in war fell to the
share of the <i>Constable</i>, the commander of the royal armies, in
the absence of the king, whose name is derived from the same title of
Stallr, held by a Comes, or Graphio, instead of by the <i>Heretoga</i>
of the whole kingdom. The <i>Mareschal</i> had not yet arrived at
the leadership of the army; his duties were still connected with the
horse, but they had increased in dignity with the growing importance
of the <i>Chevalerie</i>; for though not the head of the army, the
representative of the royal farrier had become the captain and leader
of the <i>Chivalry</i> of the age. The judicial functions of the
Stallr were performed by the <i>Grand Justiciary</i>, the President of
the royal Courts of Law; whilst the <i>Seneschal</i>, who, though he
retained his servile name, had, like the Mareschal, long discarded his
servile origin, rose to the office of “Maire du Palais;” and in France
he was also supreme over all the justiciaries. In Germany the Stallr
was unknown, the Dukes of the Alamanni, Bavarians, and Saxons, having
themselves been originally, in some sort, the Stallrs or Deputies of
the king of the Franks; and by the time that the Empire passed to the
eastward of the Rhine, the Court had become thoroughly Romanized,
the Allodial Stallr never forming any part of it. His functions
were accordingly divided between his two leading subordinates, the
Seneschal and the Mareschal, the former being the <i>Pfaltz Graf</i>,
or Count Palatine, and representing the Maire du Palais; whilst the
Mareschal was the <i>Heretoga</i>, and leader of the host. Together
with the three Chancellors and the Chamberlain, they were the first to
give their votes at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span> election of a <i>Kaiser</i>, whom they were
bound to accompany to Rome; and, in later times, with the subsequent
addition of the Grand Butler, they were known as the seven Electors,
monopolizing amongst themselves the sole choice of the Emperor.</p>

<p>Little can be said of the composition of the Anglo-Saxon Court after
the establishment of the sole monarchy by the race of Alfred, though it
was scarcely framed at first upon the Roman model, resembling rather
that of Wales or Norway, or the Teutonic <i>Hird</i>, after the freeman
rather than the noble had replaced the <i>scalc</i>. A nearer advance
towards the usages of the Feudal era is disclosed in a charter of the
Confessor’s reign, attested apparently by the royal court, the great
<i>Jarls</i> or Dukes being the leading witnesses amongst the laity;
and next to them in importance the Stallr, known under his Latin title
of “Regiæ procurator Aulæ,” probably the Constable. The <i>Aulicus</i>
seems to be the next official—he may have been the Chamberlain—and
the <i>Palatinus</i>, perhaps the Pfaltz Graf, or Seneschal of the
Household; followed by the <i>Chancellor</i>, whose office was deemed
at this time of scarcely sufficient importance to be held by one of the
higher clergy. The <i>Butlers</i> of the king and queen, with three
<i>Stewards</i>, close the list; two of the latter being attached to
the king, whilst the other was in attendance upon the queen.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
The Justiciary and the great Feudal functionary, whose name is still
identified with military command, are missed from the Court of the
Confessor; the Anglo-Saxons were not a race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span> of horsemen—chivalry and
the Mareschal came in with the Normans.</p>

<p>Some of these officials may have been introduced into the Scottish
Court by Margaret, but with the exception of the Constable, the
Justiciary, and the Chancellor, who appear in the time of Alexander,
none of the great Feudal dignitaries who were in constant attendance
upon the royal court in the middle ages are to be met with in the few
existing charters which date before the reign of David. The earliest
Constable on record was Edward, son of Siward, who fully justified the
confidence of Alexander and David on the field of Stickathrow, the
office—of which the jurisdiction, like that of the ancient Stallr,
extended over all the country within a certain distance of the royal
person—after the death of Edward, becoming hereditary in the great
Norman family of De Moreville. Alan, son of Flahald, was another
noble of the same race, who, like most of the actual followers of the
Conqueror, crossed the Channel before the general use of surnames had
arisen amongst the Normans, and upon his son, Walter, David conferred
the hereditary Seneschalship of the realm; his descendants, it need
hardly be added, deriving their name of Stewart from the dignity thus
acquired by their ancestor. Neither the Chamberlain nor the Mareschal
held their offices by a similar hereditary tenure; the former in the
capacity of royal treasurer, exercising supreme sway over the Third
Estate, who paid the largest ordinary contributions into the treasury;
holding his “Courts of Eyre” or circuits, and presiding in the great
assembly of the burghs; whilst the Mareschal was the supreme judge
and referee in Courts of Honour and of Chivalry. The Justiciary and
the Chancellor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> completed the six greater dignitaries of the Scottish
Feudal Court, Constantine, Earl of Fife, being Justiciary at the
opening of David’s reign, the only Gaelic Earl who appears at that
time amongst the leading courtiers holding office. Service about the
royal person was scarcely yet regarded as befitting the great Gaelic
Mormaors, and as the Court henceforth was in reality the Supreme
Council of the kingdom, the preponderance of the Feudal element in the
direction of affairs was quickly developed.</p>

<p>Such were the leading features of David’s civil policy; the state of
the Scottish Church, and the changes introduced during the course of
this reign, will be the subject of the ensuing chapter. The influence
of David upon his native country has been compared to that of Alfred
upon England, and of Charlemagne upon a wider sphere, but in some
respects it was of a different character. Alfred was the saviour of
the Anglo-Saxon race from complete subjection to the Danes, and though
he can scarcely be called a king of England, he was the real founder
of the monarchy. Within the limits of his ancestral dominions, and
of the rescued principality of English Mercia, he was the reviver of
letters; the creator of a navy; the reformer of the army, upon which
he expended a third of his revenue; and, as the builder of walled
towns, he may in a certain sense be regarded as the originator of a
burgherhood; but, like Charlemagne, he was a collector and not a maker
of laws, the constitutional institutions which have been attributed
to him belonging, unquestionably, to other periods. His was a policy
of defence not of aggrandisement—not even of amalgamation beyond the
limits of the Anglo-Saxon race—of defence by sea and on land; of
renovation rather than of innovation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> for it was not an era for the
development of great constitutional changes. But David was a mighty
innovator, scarcely reviving anything except bishoprics; and even
in his ecclesiastical policy, in all other respects, he was equally
an innovator. He instituted a feudal court, a feudal nobility, and
feudal tenures, governing the country upon feudal principles; for
the great dignitaries of the court, in his time, were not merely the
holders of honorary offices, but the actual ministers of the crown. He
introduced the charter into general use, confirming proprietary right
throughout the kingdom, the earls and freeholders by ancient Scottish
tenure, henceforth standing, side by side, with the new noblesse and
their vavassors, until all difference insensibly disappeared. He
created a burgherhood, and laid down a novel Code of Law, by which
the earlier system was gradually superseded by the principle still
acknowledged—“the verdict of the neighbourhood.” Augustus found Rome
brick and left her marble; but David found Scotland built of wattles
and left her framed in granite, castles and monasteries studding
the land in every direction. He found her a pastoral country, and
before the close of his reign she is described as the granary of
her neighbours; and though the expressions of Ailred are probably
exaggerated, as an exporting country she must have made considerable
progress in agriculture. England may trace the germs of her monarchy
to Alfred, and of the union of her people under one sovereign, though
it was certainly not consummated in Alfred’s time. First amongst the
Cæsars of the Western Empire stands Charlemagne, scarcely, however, the
originator of the mighty results of that revival which still continue
to influence the continent of Europe. But of feudal and historical
Scotland;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> of the Scotland which counts Edinburgh amongst her fairest
cities, and Glasgow, as well as Perth and Aberdeen; of the familiar
Scotland of Bruce and of the Stewarts, David was unquestionably the
creator. With the close of the eleventh century ancient Gaelic Alban
gradually fades into the background, and before the middle of the
twelfth, modern Scotland has already risen into existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="subhed sm">THE CHURCH.</span></h2></div>

<p>At some remote and long-forgotten period, Christianity was first
preached amongst the Provincials of Britain; and it became the
established religion of the Romanized portion of the island after
the great revolution effected by Constantine. Three British bishops
accordingly sat at the Council of Arles, as representatives of the
three Imperial provinces; and the presence of a similar deputation
from the island is occasionally noticed in the accounts of other
important councils. After the Faith had reached Britain from the
neighbouring coasts of Gaul, it appears to have passed across the
western Channel into Ireland—for there were believers in that country
at the beginning of the fifth century;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> although, from the success
attending the labours of St. Patrick amongst the leading clans of the
north and west, the conversion of the whole island has been generally
attributed to the preaching of that celebrated missionary. From the
date usually ascribed to the arrival of Patrick in Ireland, it is not
improbable that his mission to that country was connected with one of
the visits of Germanus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span> and his companions to the neighbouring island
of Britain.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The progress of the Pelagian heresy in the country
of which its originator was a native, had excited the alarm of the
orthodox Britons, who craved the assistance of their brethren in Gaul
to aid them in eradicating the evil, and at a council which was held
by the heads of the Gallican Church, Germanus and Lupus, the bishops
of Auxerre and Troyes, were commissioned to cross the Channel, and
refute the doctrines of the arch-heretic Pelagius; whilst about the
same time, the notice of Celestine, Bishop of Rome, being attracted
towards the state of the West, he dispatched Palladius, the Deacon, to
exercise episcopal functions amongst the Irish believers in the name
of Christ.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The actions of Palladius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> have long been consigned
to oblivion, but the name of Patrick is still venerated as the great
Apostle of the Truth to Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Born of parents of senatorial rank in one of the British provinces, at
the age of sixteen Patrick was carried off by a party of marauders, and
sold as a slave amongst the northern Irish.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Six years he passed
in captivity before he was enabled to effect his escape; and upwards
of twenty more elapsed, the greater part of which he probably spent
amongst the monasteries of Gaul, before he returned to settle in the
land of his birth, where his kindred earnestly entreated him to remain.
But he had long felt an ardent desire to effect the conversion of the
heathen Irish, and listening at length to the promptings of his fervent
zeal, he revisited the scene of his early captivity, and undertook the
holy task in which he was destined to be blessed with such complete
success. His lengthened residence in Gaul must have familiarised him
with the system so prevalent in that quarter; and the manner in which
Patrick appears to have planted his religious communities throughout
the provinces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> Ireland, evinces the extent to which he had been
affected by the monastic spirit of the age.</p>

<p>Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli, about the middle of the fourth century,
was the first to introduce into Western Europe the custom of the bishop
and his clergy residing together according to monastic rule, and to
familiarize the inhabitants of cities with the presence of ascetics,
hitherto confined to the desert and the wilderness. His example was
followed by Augustine of Hippo, and Martin of Tours; and through the
latter, the founder of monachism in the Gallic provinces, the system
appears to have penetrated into the British Isles. Beda has left upon
record a description of the Church of Lindisfarne, founded by Aidan
in the best days of the Gaelic Church, which identifies the customs
of that bishopric, still remaining in force at the time of the Norman
Conquest, with the practice of Eusebius and Augustine.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Nor is it
necessary to adduce the traditionary relationship between St. Martin
and the Apostle of Ireland, as a proof how largely the Churches, which
preceded the mission of Austin to the Anglo-Saxons, must have been
indebted for their characteristic features to the celebrated Bishop of
Tours.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Many of the Gaelic monasteries were founded in remote and inaccessible
situations; but the most important appear to have been placed, in
exact imitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> of the Abbey of Tours, at a short distance from the
capital, or chief fortress, of the neighbourhood. Such was the case
at Armagh, Lindisfarne, and St. Martins near Canterbury—that ancient
British church which is said to have retained the early privilege of
maintaining a bishop within its walls down to the time of the Norman
Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Here the bishop dwelt with his clergy, and the rest of
the brethren, of whom the great majority were laymen. All were bound
to the observance of the same Rule; and all, as monks, were under the
superintendence of the abbot of the community. In one point, however, a
wide difference was observable between the constitution of the Gaelic
Church, and the ecclesiastical system elsewhere prevailing; and this
peculiar variation from the general rule may, in a great degree, be
attributed to the circumstances under which monachism was originally
introduced amongst the Gaelic people.</p>

<p>After Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire, the
ecclesiastical system was naturally much influenced by the political
institutions of a highly civilized and artificial state of society.
The bishop and the city were inseparably connected; the diocese was
not unfrequently bounded by the city walls; and when a large country
district was included within the limits of the episcopal jurisdiction,
the Diocesan was assisted by one or more Chorepiscopi, or Country
Bishops, whose duties were strictly confined to that part of the
diocese from which their name was originally derived. Nothing, indeed,
more convincingly demonstrates how completely the Christianity of
early times must have been confined to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> cities of the Empire,
than the epithet of <i>Pagans</i>, or “Country people,” which was
used to distinguish those who persisted in adhering to the antiquated
superstitions of their heathen forefathers. To the two great Christian
divisions of clergy and laity, a third was added, when the increasing
multitudes of ascetics and anchorites were collected by various
pious men, and established in communities as cænobites; and when the
ordination of certain members of the fraternity—which in early times
was exclusively composed of laymen—and the introduction of the system
into cities, brought these societies within the jurisdiction of the
bishop, the authority of the Secular Head of the diocese clashed with
that of the Regular Superior of the monastery, and frequently became
a matter of dispute. Accordingly, the submission of the monks to the
Diocesan, in ecclesiastical matters, was strictly enforced, by the rule
laid down in various councils of the fifth and sixth centuries, “that
no monastery should be erected without the consent of the bishop of the
diocese.” In societies already existing, the limits of episcopal and
abbatial jurisdiction were carefully defined, whilst a few monasteries
preserved the privilege of retaining within their walls a bishop
expressly for their own community, as was the case in the abbeys of St.
Denis, and of St. Martin at Tours.</p>

<p>Such was the manner in which the abbot eventually assumed a subordinate
position beneath the recognized Head of the clerical order, wherever
the monastery was introduced upon a state of society, amongst which
a settled ecclesiastical system had long prevailed. But neither
regular dioceses, nor secular clergy, existed in Ireland at the
time when Patrick disseminated throughout that country the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> rule,
and the discipline, with which he had become familiarized in Gaul.
Monachism may be said to have brought in Christianity; and the Faith
was ingrafted on the Rule, rather than the Rule on the Faith. The
monastery was all in all, and the whole scheme of Church government
was based upon a monastic foundation. Instead of dioceses under the
jurisdiction of metropolitan and suffragan bishops, wide districts were
under the sway of different monasteries, the greater number dependant
upon some leading community, like that of Armagh, or Iona. It is not to
be supposed, however, that there were no bishops.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Every monastic
establishment of any pretension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span> possessed one bishop, sometimes
several, within the walls; but as the prelate was without a diocese, he
was in an anomalous, and in some measure in a subordinate situation.
It was amongst the privileges of the monastery of Bobbio, founded in
Italy by the Irish Columbanus, that the bishop of the diocese was
never allowed to enter the precincts of the abbey except for clerical
purposes alone; and the position in which the Italian prelate must have
been placed, during the brief period for which he remained amongst the
brotherhood of Bobbio, was the normal condition of a bishop in the
Gaelic and British Churches. As a priest, he was the ecclesiastical
Head of the whole community, upon whom he alone could confer orders;
whilst as a monk he observed the same rule as the rest of the brethren,
asserting no authority in this respect over the abbot, who, as the
Regular Superior of the Fraternity, became in reality the leading
churchman of the district.</p>

<p>Tithes and parishes were unknown, and the income of the community was
originally derived exclusively from dues and altar offerings; though,
by degrees, lands were conferred upon monasteries, fines were levied
upon offenders against certain laws, and the greater abbots asserted
their right to a <i>cuairt</i> or <i>visitation</i>, similar to that
enjoyed by the secular princes of the age.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The promulgation of the
different laws, of which the infringement was punishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> by fine, and
the progresses of the great Abbots of Armagh upon their Visitations,
with the tribute levied upon such occasions, are frequently to
be met with in the Irish annalists after the commencement of the
eighth century,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and as all fines, tributes, and other temporal
advantages, fell to the share of the Regular Superior of the monastery,
it is easy to conceive how the abbacy, rather than the bishopric, grew
to be the object of an Irish or Scottish churchman’s ambition.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
About the same time occurs the first mention of a personage, second
only in importance to the abbot—the Herenach, or lay tenant of the
lands of the monastery, answering in many respects to the Advocatus
Ecclesiæ upon the Continent. According to the invariable custom of
the Gaelic system of tenure, the possessions of the community, or
Termon lands, were made over to a tenant, generally some powerful
chieftain of the neighbourhood, in whose family the office remained as
an inalienable duchas, and who acted as the abbot’s deputy, or maor,
retaining the invariable <i>third</i> as his prerogative.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span></p>

<p>A hundred years passed away after the mission of St. Patrick before a
diversity of Rules crept into the Gaelic church, and a different mode
of celebrating the service was introduced, amongst some of the Irish
monasteries, from Britain.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> In another century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> arose the question
about Easter and the Tonsure, causing a temporary breach between the
churches of the South of Ireland—which conformed to the practice of
the Western Church towards the middle of the seventh century—and the
churches of the North which, together with those of the Picts and
Scots, and their Anglo-Saxon followers, clung to their ancient usage
till the close of the same century, or the beginning of the next,
when the Britons alone remained consistent in their attachment to the
Eastern tonsure, and to the erroneous cycle.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Long before the
death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> of Beda flagrant abuses had crept into the English Church, and
the venerable historian laments the condition into which most of the
monasteries had fallen throughout the dominions of Northumbria.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
Very similar causes to those which brought about such results in
England, were rife both in Ireland and in Scotland; and the Gaelic
Church had varied widely from its original form and spirit, when it
presented to the astonished eyes of the dignified prelates of the
Roman Church in the twelfth century a picture, in which the abuses of
encroachment and neglect had left but the shadow of a long forgotten
system of church government. The greater abbacies had become the
hereditary appanages of powerful families, where they were not still
the objects of bloody contention; and the leading members of the septs,
who filled the office of abbot, had sometimes ceased even to be in
holy orders.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The Termon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span> lands were leased out as the hereditary
property of Herenachs, members generally of the same families that
possessed the abbacies; whilst the vast communities of monks, that
Eastern peculiarity which formed so prominent a feature of the Gaelic
Church in her best days, had dwindled into small bodies of Culdees,
the representatives of the clerical portion of the brotherhood—the
<i>twelve</i> companions so invariably attending the abbots of the
early period—who were frequently as remarkable for the amount of their
private wealth, as their predecessors, in the times of Columba and
Aidan, had been renowned for their disinterested reluctance to acquire
property of any description.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>The Scottish Church, at the commencement of the twelfth century, must
have presented many similar features to those which met the eyes of
the English prelates in Ireland, towards the close of the same period.
The whole of ancient Alban had once been subject to the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of the Abbots of Iona, until the dispute between the
members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> that community and the Pictish king Nechtan appears to have
resulted in transferring the supremacy to the Superior of Abernethy;
who, in turn, yielded the predominance to the abbot or bishop of
Dunkeld, after the establishment of that monastery by Constantine
Mac Fergus. The primacy was eventually transferred during the reign
of Cyric, from the foundation of Constantine to the establishment
endowed by his brother Angus; and, from that period, the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of St. Andrews extended in exact proportion with the
temporal authority of the kings of Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Each of the provinces
that were originally independent must, at one time, have possessed
its own monastery and bishop; but as the district kings sunk under
the dominion of the supreme sovereign, the bishops either disappeared
altogether, or became subordinate to, and dependant on, the Bishop
of St. Andrews; so that only three or, at most, four sees existed in
Scotland when David ascended the throne.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> One of these must have
been the bishopric of Glasgow, created, or revived, by the king during
the lifetime of his predecessor Alexander; whilst the three remaining
sees were St. Andrews, Dunkeld, and Moray.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In two of the latter
the old abbacies had become hereditary appanages of the reigning
family, and the jurisdiction of the sees of St. Andrews and Dunkeld
embraced the whole of Scotland immediately dependant upon the royal
authority; whilst the North remained under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> the superiority of the
monastery, whichever that may have been, in which the earlier Bishops
of Moray were accustomed to fix their residence; thus demonstrating how
completely the two great provinces of <i>Scotia</i> and <i>Moravia</i>
must at one period have been divided between the rival families of
Atholl and Moray.</p>

<p>The first step towards remodelling the Scottish Church was Alexander’s
re-grant of the ancient donation of the Pictish Angus to the monastery
of St. Andrews; but many years elapsed before David was enabled to
complete the measures which his brother had only commenced. Five
other bishoprics were added to the four already existing, and the
sees of Dunblane, Brechin, Aberdeen, Ross, and Caithness, were
created, or revived, in districts where hitherto the abbacy, rather
than the bishopric, had been predominant; but it was long before all
the Scottish dioceses attained the footing of regularly established
bishoprics, like those of Glasgow and St. Andrews. In Dunkeld, the
peculiar district of the royal family, all difficulties were originally
overcome, by electing the last abbot of the Culdee monastery to be the
first bishop of the remodelled see; but very little provision was made
for the Canons before the episcopate of Geoffrey, towards the middle
of the following century. In Aberdeen, the power of appointing Canons,
and constituting a Chapter in his Cathedral, was conferred by Papal
Bull upon Bishop Edward; but the first record of a constitution dates
from the episcopate of Peter Ramsay, about 1259; whilst in Moray, the
Chapter was first created by Bishop Bryce Douglas about the year 1220.
In Caithness, the establishment dates from about 1245, the service
before that time having been performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> by a single priest, owing to
the impoverishment, through war, of a see which appears to have owed
little or nothing, in the way of endowment, to the Norwegian Magnates
of the Orkneys. Dunblane was in a very similar condition about the same
period; for although endowed by Gilbert of Strathearn with one-third of
his earldom (if Fordun is to be credited) fifteen years after the death
of this munificent patron the see had been ten years vacant through
poverty—a single chaplain, as in Caithness, celebrating divine service
in a church without a roof—a state of affairs which was remedied by
Bishop Clement in 1238.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span> With the revival of these sees by David,
the rule of discipline sanctioned by the Roman Church was introduced
into the Scottish monasteries; and wherever the authority of the Crown
was paramount, the numerous Culdee societies, which were scattered
in every direction over the face of the country at the beginning of
the twelfth century, were either suppressed altogether, or deprived
of their most important privileges. The state of the Scottish Church
at this period, and the nature of the changes brought about by David,
may be best appreciated from a sketch of the royal proceedings in the
diocese of St. Andrews, the principal bishopric of the kingdom.</p>

<p>A Prior and twelve Culdees constituted the College of Kilrimont, better
known under the subsequent name of St. Andrews. The possessions, which
they held in common, were small and poor; their private property,
which was inherited or acquired by the gifts of friends and penitents,
was large and valuable, reverting, upon the death of the possessors,
to their wives, children, or relatives. Upon seven of the community
devolved the duty of ministration at the altar; but the service was
never performed before the high altar of St. Andrews except upon
state occasions, in the presence of the king or the bishop; and at
other times the Culdees celebrated their office, after their own
peculiar manner, in a remote corner of the church. From the frequent
allusion to Seven Churches amongst the early religious societies in
Ireland and Scotland, it is probable that in ancient times each priest
officiated in a separate chapel, set apart for his own particular
ministration.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The altar-offerings were divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> seven
portions; one for the bishop, another for the hospital—that invariable
appendage of a Culdee monastery, which alone survived the changes
introduced by David; whilst the remaining five became the property of
the five Culdees, who never officiated at the altar, on the condition
of entertaining all pilgrims and strangers when the hospital (which
contained six) was full; and upon such occasions the host was decided
upon by lot. The origin of this custom may, probably, be traced to the
practice amongst the early Religious, of giving up the greater part of
the altar-offerings to a common fund, to be administered by the members
of the community who did not officiate at the altar, in relieving the
poor, and in exercising the duties of hospitality to pilgrims and
strangers. No Culdee, after his election, continued to dwell in the
same house with his wife and family.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>The privilege of electing the abbot, the bishop, and every member of
the community, was vested in the Culdees, who exercised, within the
walls of their monastery, the same rights that belonged in secular
affairs to the district and provincial chieftains. The right of blood
was as predominant amongst the ecclesiastics as it was all prevalent
amongst the laity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> of the Gaelic people; and as the abbot represented
the original Founder of the monastery, and came in time to be chosen
from the leading family of the district, so the Culdees appear to have
been selected from amongst the members of the same race who could
claim the privilege of Founder’s kin. Latterly, the abbots of the
greater monasteries in Scotland became altogether lay functionaries,
proprietors of the abbey lands, out of which the remainder of the
community were supported.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> They seem to have resembled the Herenach
rather than the abbot of the Irish Gael; whilst those ecclesiastical
duties and prerogatives, which were very generally exercised by the
Irish abbots until the arrival of the English prelates in that country,
appear to have been divided in Scotland between the bishop and the
prior.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>After the establishment and endowment of the Regular Priory of St.
Andrews by David in 1144, nearly all the privileges originally
belonging to the Culdees of Kilrimont were transferred to the Canons
Regular. The Culdees themselves were permitted to retain their
possessions for their own lives, or to embrace the Regular life and
become Canons of the newly-founded Priory;<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> but the members of
smaller Culdee establishments, like that of St. Servans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> on Loch
Leven, were treated with far less ceremony; and when their possessions
were disposed of in other quarters, they were peremptorily ordered to
conform to the Regular discipline, on pain of summary ejectment from
their monastery.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Whilst the lesser religious houses were thus
converted into small dependant priories, filled with Regular monks, the
more important communities seem frequently to have retained one part of
their ancient establishment, and to have become “Hospitallers;” so much
so, that in the succeeding century, the name of “<i>Kildey</i>” is used
as an equivalent for a Hospital.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the Culdees, after the reign of David, varied
according to the circumstances of the dioceses in which they were
placed. None can be traced to the south of the Forth, where they
appear never to have existed; nor within the limits of the see of
Moray, in which they must undoubtedly have been suppressed, upon the
forfeiture of the ancient earls of the province. In Aberdeen, only
those establishments seem to have been retained which were dependant
on the bishop of St. Andrews; whilst little or nothing is known of
the existence of Culdees in Ross and Caithness, though they probably
lingered for some time amidst the mountains of those remote districts.
In the bishoprics of St. Andrews and Dunkeld they remained in the
character of Hospitallers, retaining the tithes of certain parishes,
with the privilege of electing the prior and other members of their
fraternity, subject to the approval of the bishop. But the case was
widely different in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> dioceses of Brechin and Dunblane, where the
Culdees long shared in the privileges of the Chapter—a compromise that
must be attributed to the peculiar circumstance of those bishoprics, in
which the church-lands were held by powerful feudatories, whom it would
have been dangerous and impolitic to offend.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>But even in those dioceses in which the church lands had reverted to
the crown, either through hereditary succession, or from the forfeiture
of their earlier possessors, the Culdees, chosen from amongst the
leading provincial families, were far too powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> a body to submit
without a struggle to the loss of their former privileges.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> It
appears to have been their object to establish themselves as Regular
Canons, independent of the authority of the bishop; and they were
occasionally assisted in their endeavours to promote their aim by the
earl of the province, with whom they were frequently connected by the
ties of relationship. At the opening of the thirteenth century, the
Bishop of St. Andrews was obliged to obtain a Papal Bull to prevent
the refractory brethren of Monymusk from exchanging the character of
Hospitallers for that of Regular Canons; though the Culdees, who seem
to have enlisted in their behalf the Earl of Mar and the Bishop of
Aberdeen, eventually obtained their object, and before the middle of
the same century, they were addressed by the pope as Regular Augustine
Canons.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Frequent contests between the Culdees of Kilrimont and the Prior and
Canons of St. Andrews can be traced in the Register of that Priory.
The Culdees seem to have been connected with the Comyns and their
adherents, and to have profited by the preponderance of the national
party during the stormy minority of Alexander the Third; for not only
was a Papal Bull issued in favour of the married clergy of Scotland,
representing that they were unjustly debarred from their rights,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
but the Prior and Culdees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span> were about this time converted, by the
authority of a similar document, into the Provost and Chapter of St.
Mary’s; though a proviso was introduced into the latter Bull to secure
the privileges of the Canons of St. Andrews.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> For a short time
the Provost and Chapter of St. Mary’s appear to have been placed on
a similar footing with the Culdee Chapters of Brechin and Dunblane,
and to have re-established a claim to share in the election of the
Bishop of St. Andrews; but they were once more reduced to their former
subordination after the state of Scotland became more settled, and when
the national party came to terms with the opposite faction, to which
the Canons of St. Andrews appear to have adhered.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the century the Culdees again make their appearance,
when they elected their provost, William Comyn, to the bishopric of St.
Andrews, and as they still followed the fortunes of the party which now
supported Balliol, their appeal to Rome, in support of this election,
was backed by the whole interest of Edward of England.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The pope,
however, decided against the Culdees, and as they were now connected
with the losing side, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span> shared in the downfall of the Balliols,
and were finally subjected to the jurisdiction of the bishop of St.
Andrews.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> From this time nothing more is heard of the Culdees,
though their monastery still existed in dependance on their former
rivals; and as in the sister island the Reformation found a prior and
twelve Culdees amongst the recognized clergy at Armagh, so at the same
era in Scotland, a prior and twelve prebendaries still remained in
the little monastery of Kirkheugh, humble representatives of the once
powerful and high-born Culdees of Kilrimont.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="subhed sm">MALCOLM THE FOURTH—A.D. 1153–1165.</span></h2></div>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1153.</div>

<p>Six months had barely elapsed since the death of David before the
evil consequences of a minority became apparent, and the peace of
Scotland was again disturbed by the attempts of the Moray family
upon the Crown. Malcolm Mac Heth, the head of the race, had married
a sister of Somerled Mac Gillebride, the ancestor of the Lords of
Argyle, an energetic and ambitious chieftain, who raised the power of
the <i>Oirir-Gael</i> to a height hitherto unexampled, and who now
sought still further to increase that power by establishing one of his
sister’s children upon the throne. <span class="sni">1st Nov.</span> Upon the very
day on which the King of England and the Duke of Normandy solemnly
pledged their mutual faith to the ratification of a lasting peace, the
storm burst over the south-western coasts of Scotland, and a desultory
war seems to have lingered throughout the ensuing winter, amidst the
mountains of the west, until an offer of the kingdom of the Isles, in
the following year, called away the most formidable supporter of the
rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1103.</div>

<p>When the death of the Norwegian Magnus relieved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> the Islands from the
dominion of his son Sigurd, Man again reverted to its former ruler
Lagman Godfreyson, though the remainder of his reign was disturbed
by the unceasing attempts of his brother Harald to obtain a share in
the government. Harald, at length falling into his brother’s hands,
was punished by the loss of his eyes; <span class="sni">A. D. 1108.</span> and
soon afterwards, Lagman, filled with remorse at his own cruelty,
undertook an expiatory pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which he never lived
to accomplish. At the date of his death, his youngest brother, Olave,
was residing at the English Court; but the nobility of the Islands,
passing him over, apparently on account of his extreme youth, solicited
the appointment of a regent, or guardian to the youthful heir, from the
Irish king Murketagh O’Brien; who, gladly acceding to their request,
dispatched his brother’s son, Donald Mac Teige, to fill that office
during the minority of Olave. Donald had already given considerable
trouble in his own country, and a desire to get rid of an impracticable
kinsman may have had its weight in the selection of Murketagh; but
three years of mis-government exhausted the patience of the Manxmen,
the regent was expelled in a general rising, and a successor was this
time sought for, in the opposite direction, from Norway. <span class="sni">A.
D. 1111.</span> The change was hardly for the better, for Ingemund, the next
governor, impatient at the idea of filling a subordinate situation, on
his arrival at the Lewis, summoned the chieftains of the Northern Isles
to meet upon a stated day, and choose him for their king. He and his
Norwegians, however, conducted themselves in the meantime with such
unrestrained licentiousness, that the Islesmen, carefully guarding the
outlets, set fire to the residence of their king-elect, who perished
with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> his followers in vain attempts to escape from the flames.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1112</div>

<p>Four years had elapsed since the death of Lagman, when Olave, who was
now probably of age, assumed the government of his father’s kingdom. He
is described as a peaceful prince, voluptuous and devout—a combination
of opposite features in the same character, by no means confined to
that age—and his residence at the Court of Henry the First appears to
have assimilated his character in some respects to that of the Scottish
David, with whom he is also said to have cultivated a close alliance.
He instituted, or remodelled, the bishopric of the Isles, establishing
a priory at Rushen, which he filled with a body of monks from Furness
Abbey, conferring upon the latter monastery the privilege of electing
the bishop of the Isles. Their first choice was unfortunate, and Olave
became the patron of that singular bishop, Wimund, whose vagaries,
towards the close of David’s reign, have been already noticed in a
preceding chapter.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1152.</div>

<p>Towards the close of a long and peaceful reign, Olave dispatched his
son Godfrey to Norway, to obtain from Inge, who then ruled over that
kingdom, a confirmation of his claim upon the throne of the Isles.
Hardly had Godfrey left his home, when the three sons of the blind
Harald, landing upon the coast of Man, asserted their claim to a share
in the kingdom, as the lawful inheritance of their father. Olave
agreed to submit the question to the general assembly of the Manxmen,
and, on the 29th of June, both parties met at Ramsay, when Ronald
Haraldson, rising under pretence of opening the conference, struck the
unsuspecting Olave to the ground with his battle-axe, and proclaimed
himself and his brothers kings of the Isles. <span class="sni">A. D. 1153.</span>
Their usurpation, however, was of short duration, for upon the return
of Godfrey Olaveson from Norway, the whole of the island chieftains at
once declared in favour of Olave’s heir; and the sons of Harald, who
were made over to their kinsman, suffered the usual punishment of a
cruel age for their treacherous outrage upon his father.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after his return to Man, overtures were made to Godfrey to
cross over to Dublin and place himself at the head of the Northmen of
Fingal, or Dublin <i>Ostmen</i> as they now began to be called. He
willingly responded to the invitation, but by adopting this course, and
by some of his subsequent proceedings, he appears to have provoked the
serious enmity of one of the leading magnates of the Isles. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> the
conquest of Man by Godfrey Crovan, the original clans, whose connection
with the Northmen of Dublin and the Isles has been already noticed,
were confined to the north of the island; whilst the south, partitioned
out amongst the Islesmen who had contributed to the success of Godfrey,
remained in the possession of their descendants, and became the seat
of the government, the locality of the episcopal see, and the favoured
portion of the island. The names of the leaders in the sanguinary
battle of Sandwirth, Ottir and Mac Maras, point to the different
descent of their followers; and it appears to have been the policy of
Godfrey Crovan and his descendants to preserve the distinction between
North and South, and to maintain their own ascendancy by holding the
balance between the two races.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1142.</div>

<p>About ten years before Godfrey became connected with the Dublin
Ostmen, Reginald Mac Torquil, a grandson of Jarl Ottir who fell at
Sandwirth—and, perhaps, also a member of the old Hy Ivar race, which
probably still lingered in the north of Man—had either been chosen,
or deputed, to assume the government of the Dublin Norsemen, this
leadership remaining in the possession of his descendants until the
capture of Dublin by the English.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The arrival of the king of
Man must have interfered with the authority of Reginald, and, upon
his return home, Godfrey appears to have directed his enmity still
further against the family of Reginald by depriving Thorfin Ottirson
of his possessions in the island. <span class="sni">A. D. 1156</span> Thirsting for
vengeance Thorfin sought out Somarled, who had married the sister of
Godfrey Olaveson, undertaking to place one of the great chief’s sons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
upon the throne of the Isles in right of his maternal ancestry. Most
readily was the offer accepted, and Thorfin, accompanied by Somarled’s
eldest son Dugal, sailed amongst the northern islands, exacting the
submission of their chieftains to the joint heir of the Isles and the
Oirir-Gael, whilst Somarled, on his part, prepared to support his
son’s claim with a powerful fleet of eighty vessels. <span class="sni">6th
Jan. <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1157.</span> The proceedings of Thorfin could scarcely
escape the notice of Godfrey, and he was fully prepared to meet
the confederates when they appeared off the coasts of Man, where a
desperate and bloody battle, lasting through a whole winter’s night,
and terminating in favour of Somarled, led to the partition of the
islands; the permanent cession of all the <i>Sudreys</i>, or Southern
Hebrides, striking a fatal blow at the ancient ascendancy of the
Gall-Gael. Not content, however, with his partial success, the lord of
the Oirir-Gael aimed at the possession of the remainder, <span class="sni">
A. D. 1158.</span> and in the following year, landing in Man, he completed
his conquest by the reduction of that island, Godfrey flying before
his sister’s husband, and passing the next seven years in exile at the
court of Norway.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The defection of Thorfin from Godfrey Olaveson was, probably, as fatal
in its consequences to the sons of Mac Heth as it was advantageous
to their powerful kinsman; for in the very year in which Somarled,
relinquishing his attacks upon Scotland, turned all his energies
towards acquiring the kingdom of the Isles, Donald Mac Malcolm was
captured in Galloway, <span class="sni">A. D. 1156.</span> and sent to share his
father’s imprisonment in Roxburgh Castle.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Three and twenty years
of hopeless captivity must have bowed the spirit of the forlorn
prisoner, and despairing of success when his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> son became the partner
of his dungeon, Malcolm Mac Heth came to terms with his enemies.
<span class="sni">A. D. 1157.</span> No account remains of the nature of the
transaction by which he at length repurchased his liberty; of the
claims which he relinquished, or of the concessions extorted by his
opponents. Once only his name occurs in the chartularies of the period,
when it appears amongst the signatures of the leading nobles who were
in attendance at the court of their youthful sovereign at Dunfermlyn;
and then, with one solitary and insignificant exception, the name of
the once mighty leaders of the ancient race of Moray disappears for
ever from the page of history.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Three years had elapsed since the death of Stephen, and a very
different monarch now filled the throne of England. A true descendant
of the Norman conqueror, Henry Fitz Empress seems to have reunited, in
his own character, the different qualities bequeathed by his mighty
ancestor between his younger sons, and, together with the politic
sagacity of his maternal grandfather, the young king displayed all
the fiery passions of Rufus. Astute, ambitious, and little scrupulous
about the means by which his ends were attained, his first aim was
to re-establish the royal authority upon the destruction of the
all but independent power achieved by many of the greater nobles.
William Peveril, Hugo Mortimer, and the great Earl of Yorkshire—the
same William Albemarle who won his earldom upon Cutton Moor—were
either reduced to submission, or driven from the realm; and the once
all-powerful Bishop of Winchester deemed it prudent to consult his
safety in flight, seeking a surer refuge with his treasure in the
monastery of Clugny. In pursuance of a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> line of policy, after
the death of the Earl of Northampton, upon whom Stephen had conferred
the Honor of Huntingdon, had again placed that fief at the disposal
of the English king, Henry caused it to be notified to the young
king of Scotland, that he expected the restoration of all the fiefs
in the North of England which had been held by David in the name of
the Empress Queen. Such was the light in which Henry now chose to
regard the feudal dependance of the northern counties upon the king of
Scots; for of all the contracting parties who joined in the treaty of
Carlisle, eight years before, he alone survived, and, secure in the
possession of the throne of England, he little regarded the word he
had plighted in his days of exile and adversity to the firmest friend
of his early youth.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Compliance was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> the only course left open to
Malcolm, <span class="sni">A. D. 1157.</span> and meeting Henry at Chester, he made
a formal resignation of the three northern counties, with the castles
of Carlisle, Bamborough, and Newcastle on Tyne, putting forward his
claims upon Huntingdon on the same occasion, and receiving immediate
investment of the Honor, upon the same terms of homage as it had been
held by David in the days of the first Henry.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> <span class="sni">A. D.
1158.</span> In the following year the two kings again met at Carlisle,
but the honour of knighthood which he appears to have expected was
not conferred upon Malcolm, as a coolness had arisen about some
long-forgotten point connected, probably, with the performance of
feudal service for the fief of Huntingdon; for, in the ensuing year,
after Malcolm had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> accompanied the English king in the expedition
against Toulouse, <span class="sni">A. D. 1159.</span> which was rendered abortive
through the royal scruples about attacking a town which contained
the person of his own feudal superior the king of France, the
coveted ceremony was performed at Tours, and the young king returned
immediately to Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>The departure of their king to render feudal service as an English
baron, was viewed with general disapproval by the Scots, to whom
this phase of the English connection appears to have been always
distasteful. For nearly twenty years David and his grandson had enjoyed
in succession the advantages of their English fiefs, without the burden
of their feudal obligations; as during the lifetime of Stephen, and for
the first three years of his successor’s reign, no king of Scotland had
ever met an English sovereign except at the head of a hostile army.
Under these circumstances, the cession of all the advantages which had
been acquired by David, the revival of a closer feudal connection with
England, above all, the departure of the king for France, in direct
opposition to the wishes of the great body of his native followers,
aroused a spirit of disaffection; a formidable conspiracy appears to
have been set on foot during his absence in France, and in his anxiety
to win his spurs in the service of Henry, Malcolm risked the loss of
his crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span></p>

<p>A veil of deep mystery enshrouds the proceedings of the conspirators.
Foremost amongst their number was Ferquhard, Earl of Strathearn, whose
father, Malise, had been the spokesman of the discontented Scots at the
battle of the Standard; together with a certain Gilleanrias Ergemauche,
and five other magnates, or “Mayster men,” as Wynton calls them,
including perhaps the Earl of Ross and the Lord of Galloway, or his
sons. <span class="sni">A. D. 1160.</span> Malcolm was holding his court at Perth,
soon after his return from France, when the confederates suddenly
surrounded the city, intending, either to secure the person of the king
and dictate their own terms, or, as one historian affirms, to place his
brother William on the throne. None of the race of Malcolm Ceanmore
ever failed in the hour of danger, and the young king displayed, in
this crisis, all the hereditary courage of his ancestry. Promptly
assuming the offensive, he at once attacked the conspirators, drove
them from the field, and following up his first success, led an army
into Galloway, in the determination of crushing the insurrection at its
source.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span></p>

<p>The history of Galloway is a blank from the time when the father of
Kenneth the First was slain upon the borders of Kyle, until the age in
which the mutinous spirit of its unruly contingent to David’s army more
than counterbalanced the utmost efforts of their reckless valour. Three
centuries of antagonism appear to have engendered a feeling of bitter
hostility between the Galwegians and their neighbours of Scottish
Cumbria and the Lothians; whilst their continual encroachments upon the
ancient kingdom of Strath Clyde must, from a very early period, have
tended to throw the people of that province upon the protection of the
Scottish kings, and materially to advance the policy which eventually
placed a branch of the Mac Alpin family upon the Scoto-Cumbrian throne.
At some remote era the Lord of Galloway became dependant upon the king
of Scotland, and Fergus, the first known prince of the province, was
an attendant on certain state occasions at the royal court, whilst he
acknowledged the superiority of his contemporary David by the payment
of a certain tribute in time of peace, and by a contingent of turbulent
soldiery in war; resembling, in other respects, an ally rather than a
vassal, and enjoying a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span> considerable degree of independence within his
hereditary dominions. He married Elizabeth, a natural daughter of Henry
the First, and Afreca, his daughter by this union, became the wife of
Olave and the mother of Godfrey, kings of Man and the Isles; the latter
connection, apparently, involving him in the attempts of Somerled, Mac
Heth, and others, who opposed the reigning family, either in the hope
of advancing their own rival claims, or through a repugnance to the
introduction of a novel system. It was in Galloway that Donald Mac Heth
sought his last retreat, and amidst the mountains and moors of the same
locality the discomfited conspirators seem to have hoped, after their
defeat at Perth, to elude the pursuit of Malcolm. Twice was the king
baffled in his attempts to penetrate the province; as much, probably,
from the natural difficulties of the country, as from the magnitude
of the opposition he encountered; but on the third occasion he was
successful. Fergus, reduced at length to liege submission, retired,
either of his own accord or from compulsion, into the monastery of
Holyrood, where he died in the course of the following year; the
whole of Galloway, thoroughly subdued, was brought into direct feudal
subjection to the Scottish crown; and a conspiracy, which at one time
threatened to entail the loss of a crown, through the energy and
abilities of the youthful sovereign, or of his advisers, terminated in
the acquisition of a principality.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span></p>

<p>But Malcolm was never destined to fulfil the high promise of his
youthful career, the delicacy of constitution, bequeathed by Queen
Margaret to so many of her descendants, early developing itself in her
grandson’s eldest child. <span class="sni">A. D. 1163.</span> Three years after the
conquest of Galloway, during his progress towards the south, he was
overtaken by a dangerous illness at Doncaster; though his days were not
yet numbered, and he recovered sufficiently to carry out the original
purpose of his visit to England, concluding an alliance with Henry that
promised to ensure a firm and lasting peace.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> He is also stated to
have been present shortly afterwards at Woodstock, to tender his homage
to the younger Henry, as his grandfather had done to the empress-queen,
with the usual reservation of fealty to the elder king.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1164.</div>

<p>One more triumph was in store to grace the closing years of his career.
Within a year or two of the liberation of Malcolm Mac Heth from
Roxburgh Castle, the lord of the Oirir-Gael appears to have made his
peace with the king of Scotland; though for some unknown cause, in the
year 1164, he again broke out into open rebellion, landing suddenly
on the coast of Renfrew with the whole force of Argyle and the Isles,
strengthened by a body of auxiliaries from Ireland. Hardly had he set
foot on shore before he fell, with his son Gillecolum—tradition says
by treachery—and his followers dispersing, as usual, upon the death of
their leader, returned at once to their island homes. Thus perished,
in an obscure skirmish, the mightiest and most formidable of Malcolm’s
enemies; the chieftain who raised the power of the Lords of Argyle upon
the ruins of the ancient kingdom of the Gall-Gael.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>The defeat of Somerled was the final event in Malcolm’s reign, for the
hand of death was already upon him, and, on the 9th of December 1165,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1165.</span> he sunk into the grave, at the early age of
twenty-four. His premature decease lent an interest to his memory, and
may, in a great measure, have led the historians of the succeeding
generation to invest the character of the king with the qualities
which were supposed, in those days, to constitute the attributes of a
saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> upon earth. A certain effeminacy of appearance, resulting from
his constitutional delicacy, may have originated the epithet of “the
Maiden,” by which he was so often known; and though the same cause may
have undoubtedly affected the tone of his mind, so far from having
been an ascetic recluse, as he is frequently represented—more fit to
wear the cowl than to wield the sword—whenever Malcolm appears in
history, he stands forward as a prince of exceeding promise and spirit.
His reign was principally taken up in quelling the disaffection of
different powerful magnates, above all, of Somerled, whose hostility
only ceased with his life; and the character of the young king may be
best estimated by the successful result of those measures, through
which he secured the direct feudal submission of the principality of
Galloway, and the total cessation of all internal revolt during the
early years of his successor.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>A singular policy—recalling to mind the compulsatory migrations of
conquered races in the remote era of the early eastern empires—has
been attributed by Fordun to this king; who is supposed, by that
historian, to have transplanted the original inhabitants of Moray
from their ancient province, repeopling the district with settlers
from other parts of his dominions.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> If such a proceeding was ever
carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> out, it may have originated in the arrangement with Malcolm
MacHeth; but though it is impossible to pronounce with absolute
certainty upon the accuracy of Fordun’s statement, it is very difficult
to imagine that such a measure could have extended throughout the
Highland portion of the district subsequently erected into an earldom
for Randolph. The race, the language, and many of the customs of the
mountaineers, remained unchanged at a comparatively recent period; and
whilst the lowlands and the coast of Moray, which had already been
partitioned out amongst the followers of David, would have presented
comparatively few obstacles to such a project, it is hardly possible to
conceive how it could ever have been successfully put into execution
amidst the wild and inaccessible mountains of the interior. It appears,
therefore, most reasonable to conclude, that Malcolm only carried out
the policy pursued by his grandfather ever since the first forfeiture
of the earldom; and that any changes that may have been brought about
in the population of this part of Scotland—and which scarcely extended
below the class of lesser <i>Duchasach</i>, or small proprietors—are
not to be attributed to one sweeping and compulsatory measure, but to
the grants of David and his successors; which must have had the effect
of either reducing the earlier proprietary to a dependant position, or
of driving into the remoter Highlands all who were inclined to contest
the authority of the sovereign, or to dispute the validity of the royal
ordinances, which reduced them to the condition of subordinates.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="subhed sm">WILLIAM THE LION—1165–1214.</span></h2></div>

<p>Amongst the earliest acts of William after his accession was the
performance of feudal service for the fief of Huntingdon, accompanying
Henry for this purpose upon one of his numerous expeditions into the
French territories. <span class="sni">A. D. 1166.</span> By his ready acquiescence
on a point about which his brother had at first demurred, he may have
hoped to influence the English king in favour of his claim upon the
northern counties; but if he entertained such expectations he was
doomed to disappointment, as Henry limited his grant to the Honor of
Huntingdon.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>William, however, was not of a disposition to submit with patience
to the denial of his rights—for thus would he have characterised
his claims; and he was ready to enter warmly into any confederacy
promising to extort from the fears of Henry the cession of the coveted
fiefs. Two campaigns against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> Welsh, conducted with more than
equivocal success; the continued hostility of Louis of France; and a
doubtful contest with the newly made Archbishop of Canterbury, whose
former reputation as a man-at-arms was destined to be eclipsed by
his subsequent renown as a martyr,<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> heightened the difficulties
of Henry’s situation: and his exasperation was increased against the
king of Scotland, whose envoys at the French court, uniting with the
representatives of the Welsh princes, were eager to enter into a league
with the enemies of the English king.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1168.</span>
But the hostility of William was not yet to be openly displayed, for
a peace was concluded between the French and English kings, and the
opportunity of attacking the latter at a disadvantage passed away.
<span class="sni">A. D. 1170.</span> It was with an appearance, therefore, of
renewed cordiality, that William and his brother David appeared at
the court of Henry, to assist at the coronation of his eldest son at
Westminster; when both the Scottish princes, taking the oaths of fealty
and allegiance to the younger Henry, swore upon the sacred relics to be
true to the heir of England, saving, as usual, their fidelity to his
father.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> But in spite of these professions of mutual friendship,
the alliance in reality was hollow and insincere, the refusal of the
northern counties still rankled in the breast of William, and an
opportunity for enforcing his claim was not long wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1173.</div>

<p>Never did the fortunes of the second Henry appear more prosperous than
at the very moment when the flight of his eldest son to the court of
France, suddenly revealed the extent of the intrigues which were based
upon the disaffection of his own children. Whilst the elder king was
occupied in strengthening his defences upon the frontiers of France
and in securing the important services of twenty thousand Reiters
of Brabant, the younger Henry was busily corrupting the unfaithful
adherents of his father, and lavishing grants upon the allies whose
assistance he wished to purchase. The promise of Northumberland to
William, and the offer of the fief of Cambridge to his brother, the
Earl of Huntingdon, secured the active co-operation of both the
Scottish princes;<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> and towards the close of summer, whilst the
attention of the elder Henry was fully occupied in Normandy, the
frontiers of England were suddenly invaded from the north.</p>

<p>Siege was laid to Werk and Carlisle, whilst the main body of
irregulars, according to the usual tactics of Scottish armies, was
dispatched to lay waste the surrounding country. The Bishop of Durham
appears to have secretly favoured the confederates, and the Scots were
allowed a free passage through the lands of his diocese;<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> but their
further progress was checked, before long, by tidings of the approach
of a powerful force under the orders of Richard de Lucy, and Humphrey
de Bohun, the Justiciary and Constable of England. Raising the siege
of Carlisle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span> William retired across the borders, closely followed
by de Lucy and de Bohun, who were beginning to retaliate upon the
Lothians the ravages of the Scottish army in England, when the arrival
of messengers from the south, brought the unwelcome intelligence of
the landing of the Earl of Leicester on Michaelmas Day. Negotiations
were hastily opened with the Scottish king, and so well did the English
commanders succeed in concealing the real state of affairs, that they
obtained a truce until the following January, and were thus enabled to
lead back their army to oppose the Earl of Leicester, and to bend all
their energies towards confronting the novel danger.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>During the whole of the ensuing winter the war was carried on in
England without intermission, whilst, with the singular policy of the
age, a truce existed in all other quarters; thus enabling the partizans
of Henry, in his own kingdom, to unite their forces for the purpose of
crushing the Earl of Leicester.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1174.</span> At the
expiration of the truce in January, the payment of 300 marks, offered
by the barons of Northumberland through the medium of the bishop of
Durham, purchased from William a further cessation of hostilities until
Easter; and when the term of this second truce had also expired, the
armies of the allies<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> at length appeared in the field.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> Whilst
Louis prosecuted the war in Normandy, and the Count of Flanders, with
the younger Henry, meditated a descent upon England, William again
crossed the Borders with an army, strengthened by a body of mercenaries
from the Low Countries;<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> his brother David proceeding at once
to the south, as the earl had been chosen to command the English
confederates, now left without a head through the capture of the Earl
of Leicester.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Leaving a division of his army to blockade Carlisle, William led the
main body into Northumberland. Brough and Appleby were captured without
resistance, and the castles of Liddel, Warkworth, and Harbottle, fell,
in succession, into the hands of the Scots, who then retraced their
steps to Carlisle. A close blockade extorted a promise of surrender
from the castellan, Robert de Vaux, if no relief arrived before
Michaelmas; for his provisions were beginning to fail, and he suspected
the townsmen—attached, probably, to the memory of David, who had
often made Carlisle his residence—of a favourable inclination towards
the Scots. William then marched to invest Prudhoe Castle, upon the
southern bank of the Tyne, where he was joined by Robert de Mowbray,
the youngest of the victors of Northallerton, who, sorely pressed by
the warlike bishop of Lincoln, eagerly advocated the advance of the
Scots into Yorkshire, before the fall of his last castle of Thirsk,
placing his eldest son in the hands of William as a hostage for the
sincerity of his request. William promised to march to his assistance,
but, warned of the approach of the Yorkshire barons, he relinquished
his intention of relieving Thirsk, and, raising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span> siege of Prudhoe
Castle, commenced his retreat towards the north.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>As he approached his own frontiers, the king dispatched the greater
part of his army, under the command of Duncan, Earl of Fife, with
instructions to disperse his forces over the face of the country,
and carry out the usual tactics of Scottish warfare. In order to
extend the circuit of his operations, Earl Duncan subdivided the
forces committed to his charge, entrusting two separate divisions to
Richard de Moreville and the Earl of Angus; whilst with the main body
under his immediate command he entered Warkworth upon the morning of
Saturday, the 13th of July; and the inhabitants of that place, no
longer protected by the garrison of the castle, fell an easy prey
to his followers. The town was burnt to the ground, and more than a
hundred miserable beings, who, in the vain hope of safety, had fled to
the Church of St. Lawrence, were torn from its sacred precincts and
massacred with remorseless cruelty. Little did Earl Duncan imagine,
as he contemplated the ruins of the burning church, that within a few
short miles the fate of Scotland was trembling in the balance.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Upon reaching Newcastle, late on the evening of the 12th of July, the
Yorkshire Barons, so often destined to render good service to England,
found that the Scottish army had retreated; when a difference of
opinion arose as to the expediency of a further pursuit. Several of
their number urged that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> already done enough in frustrating
the intentions of the enemy against their own neighbourhood, and that
it would be merely courting unnecessary danger to pursue eight thousand
armed men with only four hundred horsemen. But there were others
amongst their ranks who argued that much might be done by a compact and
well-equipped body of knights, whilst the Scottish army was dispersed
over the country, and whilst William was still in ignorance of their
approach; and by the arguments and the authority of those who were in
favour of an advance, the hesitation of the dissentients was at length
overcome, and the bolder counsels prevailed.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>At earliest dawn upon the 13th, the Barons set out from Newcastle. A
dense fog overhung the country, appearing to increase as they advanced
northwards; and it was still early, though they had ridden fast and
far, when several of the party began to suggest the expediency of a
return, urging, that in their utter ignorance of their own locality,
as well as of the position of the enemy, they might be blindly rushing
upon unknown perils.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> But Balliol, with a resolute determination
that has often extricated brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> men out of difficulties, refused to
listen to such suggestions, avowing his own intention of proceeding at
all risks, and the waverers were ashamed to turn back. Onwards they
pressed, whilst close upon their right lay Warkworth, swarming with
the Scottish foe; but enshrouded in the obscurity of the friendly mist
they passed the river Coquet in safety, and continued their adventurous
progress. The fog rolled away as the morning advanced, displaying to
the delighted eyes of the little band the friendly walls of Alnwick,
and they were hastening with alacrity towards its welcome shelter, when
they perceived a small body of about sixty knights, who were engaged
in tilting in a neighbouring meadow. The tilting party was composed
of William and his attendant suite, who paid little or no attention
to the approach of a band of horsemen, mistaking them for a party of
Earl Duncan’s mounted force returning to the Scottish camp, until a
nearer view of the advancing barons revealed the English cognizances.
One moment of reflection would have warned the king not to imperil the
whole fortune of the war upon such an unequal contest; but no such
thoughts crossed the mind of William, and, with the hasty exclamation,
“Now will it be seen who is a true knight,” he dashed at once against
the enemy with all the reckless gallantry of a knight-errant. The
result can be easily imagined. His horse was immediately slain—for
this was no tilting match, and his opponents aimed at securing their
prize—and before he could disengage himself from the dying charger,
William was a helpless captive. His nobles determined to share his
fate; many of his suite, who had not been present at the catastrophe,
riding in and surrendering to the English barons to avoid the
imputation of deserting their sovereign;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> and, before the close of the
same fatal Saturday, the Barons of Yorkshire again entered Newcastle
with their illustrious captive in their charge.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>On the following morning the royal prisoner was removed, for greater
security, to Richmond castle; and the important intelligence of his
capture was forwarded in haste to London, where Henry had by this time
arrived. Alarmed at the assemblage of the hostile fleet, and anxious
to be upon the spot to oppose the threatened invasion, he had crossed
from Barfleur in a gale of wind, undeterred by the elements which held
his enemies wind-bound at Gravelines, reaching Southampton in safety
on the evening of the 8th of July. All that night, and the following
day, he is said to have hurried on, without rest or refreshment beyond
bread and water, to the tomb of the murdered Becket, at whose shrine
either policy, or repentance, dictated the performance of a penance,
that, to the ideas of the present age, appears degrading. After he
reached London, fatigue and excitement threw him into a fever, from
which he was only partially recovered, when the messenger of Ranulph de
Glanville, standing by the side of his bed on the morning of Thursday
the 18th, aroused him from sleep, before daylight, with the welcome
intelligence of William’s capture. All remembrance of his illness
vanishing at the joyful tidings, before the close of the same day
Henry departed for the north; and ere a fortnight had elapsed from the
date of his misfortune, the royal captive was removed from Richmond
castle, his legs were fettered under the body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span> a horse, and in this
degrading position he was presented to Henry at Northampton.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>The effects of the calamity which had befallen the king of Scotland
were at once instantaneous and decisive. His own army, stunned for the
moment, only recovered to break out, as usual, into mutual dissension
and strife. Gilbert and Uchtred, the lords of Galloway, hurrying
homewards, destroyed the castles which had been built in their province
to secure the authority of the king, drove out the royal officers, and
then dispatched gifts and envoys to the English king with the offer
of their fealty and submission. The Scots availed themselves of the
anarchy of the moment to vent their long suppressed animosity against
the townsmen and burghers, mostly of English origin, with whom David
and his successors had filled the royal burghs and cities of their
kingdom. The Earl of Huntingdon, relinquishing his high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> command,
returned in haste to Scotland. Ferrers and De Mowbray threw themselves
on Henry’s mercy; Gloucester and De Clare, the waverers of the western
counties, met him with assurances of their fidelity; Hugh Bigot
dismissed his Flemish auxiliaries; and the Bishop of Durham surrendered
his castles, protesting that the presence of his nephew, the Count de
Bar, was merely for his own protection: whilst the formidable fleet,
which had threatened the invasion of the English coasts, melted away at
the news of the disaster; and the Count of Flanders, with the younger
Henry, drew off their forces from Gravelines to join Louis of France at
the siege of Rouen. Within three weeks from the date of the catastrophe
the power of Henry was re-established throughout England; and, as he
had nothing more to fear in his own kingdom, he prepared to face his
opponents in France, <span class="sni">8th Aug.</span> and sailed with his Scottish
prisoners for Normandy. Such were the first consequences of William’s
fatal error, in mistaking the rash folly of “a true knight” for the
gallant bearing of a king.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>In another month the war was brought to a triumphant conclusion by the
elder Henry, who, at the personal request of Louis of France, set all
his prisoners at liberty, with the exception of the king of Scotland,
detaining William in fetters at Falaise until the month of December,
before the terms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span> his release were finally arranged.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> They may
be briefly described as follows:—</p>

<p>William was to become the liegeman of his lord, the King Henry, for
Scotland, Galloway, and all his other lands, and to perform fealty
to his liege lord in the same way as other vassals. His brother, his
barons, his clergy, and all his other vassals, were to become the
liegemen of the English crown, acknowledging that they held their lands
of the English king, and swearing to support him, their liege lord,
against the king of Scotland, if the latter ever failed in his fidelity.</p>

<p>The Scottish Church was to acknowledge the subjection due to the
English Church; and the English Church was to possess all those rights
over the Scottish Church to which the former was justly entitled.</p>

<p>For the strict observance of this convention, the castles of Berwick,
Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling, were to be made over to
Henry, and to receive English garrisons, all expenses being defrayed
by the Scottish king; David, and twenty-one of the earls and barons of
Scotland, were to remain as hostages until the delivery of the castles;
while each of these noblemen was further required to give up his son,
or his next heir, as a pledge for the due performance of his part of
the treaty after his own release. Three days after the conclusion of
the convention of Falaise, William was allowed to leave his Norman
prison, and proceed, in the first instance, to England; where he was to
remain, in a state of comparative freedom, until the castles already
mentioned were delivered over to the officers of the English king.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span></p>

<p>The conduct of Henry upon this occasion has been characterised by his
advocates as generous and lenient; whilst it has been stigmatised
by his opponents as harsh and illiberal. Neither view appears to be
correct. When William, conceiving himself to have been aggrieved,
united in a confederacy which, if successful, would have probably
confined Henry within the walls of a monastery for the remainder of
his life, the Scottish king was fully prepared to profit to the utmost
at the expense of his enemy’s weakness; and Henry did no more with the
captive of Falaise than William would have done had their positions
been reversed. But to maintain, as it has been sometimes asserted,
that he might have put his prisoner to death, is to argue with a total
disregard of the principles and sentiments of an age in which the
death of an independent prince, like William, would have been even
more revolting to the feelings of his contemporaries, than the public
scourging of Henry in Canterbury Cathedral would be unsuitable to the
ideas of the present time. In depriving his captive of his English
fiefs, which were justly forfeited, and in extorting liege homage for
Scotland, Henry displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span> neither mercy nor leniency, simply availing
himself, to the utmost, of an opportunity for advancing his own
interests at the expense of his unfortunate rival; and his conduct was
that of an able and unsparing politician, exacting his own terms from
a fallen foe. As such, it must be judged; and, as such, it is far less
open to censure, than his repudiation in prosperity of the promises
which he made in his adversity to his earliest and most faithful ally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1175.</div>

<p>In the course of the summer after the release of William, both the
English kings, who now affected the closest intimacy and regard,
repaired in company to York: and here, upon the 10th of August, they
were met by the king of Scotland, bringing with him Earl David, no
longer lord of Huntingdon, with the bishops, abbots, earls, barons,
knights, and other freeholders of Scotland, who united with their king
in swearing fealty to the two Henries, and in ratifying the convention
of Falaise. All became the liegemen of the English kings in the
Cathedral church of St. Peter—a fabric of an earlier date than the
present noble minster—and yet further to secure the exact fulfilment
of the treaty, the clergy swore to lay their native land under an
interdict, and the laity pledged themselves to hold, as true men, to
their English suzerains, if ever William of Scotland proved unfaithful
to his oath.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>For fifteen years the convention of Falaise remained in full force,
and every action of Henry, down to the day of his death, exhibits
the tenacity with which he clung to its scrupulous fulfilment. Not a
papal legate was allowed to enter Scotland who had not first sworn to
do nothing detrimental to the interests of the English king, with an
additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> promise to return through England—a proviso that precluded
the possibility of evasion—whilst a similar pledge was exacted from
all the Scottish clergy who attended the eleventh Council at the
Lateran. William was continually summoned to attend, as a vassal, at
the Court of his English lord; and he brought his earls and barons,
when required, to assist at the councils of their common superior. He
crossed the sea to Normandy, at the command of Henry, to submit to that
king’s decision in his dispute about the bishopric of St. Andrews;
license was granted for his expeditions into Galloway; and he conducted
the lords of that province to perform fealty to Henry, or to promise
to abide by the decrees of the English court. In short, a comparison
between the usual state of Scotland, and her condition during these
fifteen years of real feudal subjection, affords one of the clearest
and most convincing proofs of her entire freedom from all dependance
upon her southern neighbour, at every other period of her history,
before the reign of the first Edward.</p>

<p>The oaths of fealty and allegiance tendered in the church of St. Peter
riveted upon Scotland the yoke of feudal dependance; but her Church was
destined to vindicate with success her ecclesiastical liberties, and to
evade the claims of the English metropolitans, which a special clause
in the convention of Falaise had, to all appearance, triumphantly
established. The contest which embittered the whole of the reign of
Alexander, seems to have slumbered in the days of David, to break out
afresh in the time of his eldest grandson, Malcolm, when the papal
chair was occupied by Nicolas Breakespear, under the title of Adrian
IV., the only Englishman who ever rose to be the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> of the Church of
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> His partiality to the land of his nativity was frequently
manifested, and availing himself of the papal claim to dominion over
all the islands, founded upon the imaginary Donation of Constantine, he
willingly lent himself to the ambitious policy of Henry, authorising
that king to conquer, and exact obedience from, the people of Ireland
for the advancement of the interests of the Roman Church.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> It is
also probable that Adrian was inclined to favour the pretensions of the
English metropolitans to the obedience of the Scottish bishops; for,
immediately upon his death, a mission was dispatched to the next pope,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1159.</span> and the successive appointments of the bishops
of Moray and St. Andrews to the office of papal legate for Scotland
guaranteed, for the time, the independence of the Scottish Church.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>Upon the death of the bishop of St. Andrews, Roger, archbishop
of York—the same prelate who was the rival and opponent of
Becket—obtained the office of legate for England, <span class="sni">A. D.
1163.</span>and repaired to Norham towards the close of Malcolm’s reign, to
summon the Scottish bishops to submit to his pretensions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span> Ingelram
the archdeacon, and Solomon the dean of Glasgow, with Walter, prior of
Kelso, were deputed to maintain the liberties of their Church; both
parties appealed to Rome, and the Scots achieved a notable triumph when
Ingelram was consecrated to the bishopric of Glasgow in spite of the
opposition of the archbishop.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The dispute again languished until the concessions recently extorted
from William appeared to deal a death-blow to all the liberties
of Scotland. <span class="sni">A. D. 1176.</span> A great council was held at
Northampton in the January after the meeting at York, at which, in
obedience to a summons from his suzerain, William was in attendance
with the bishops, abbots, and other ecclesiastical dignitaries of his
kingdom, as liege subjects of the English king; and at the conclusion
of the council the Scottish clergy were commanded, upon their
allegiance, and in virtue of the oath which they had already sworn,
to acknowledge their dependance upon the English Church. They denied
that any such submission was due; and in reply to the assertion of
the archbishop of York that the bishops of Glasgow and Galloway were
rightfully his suffragans, Jocelyn of Glasgow, the spokesman of the
Scottish party, affirmed that his see was “the daughter of Rome,” and
consequently independent of all other authority.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>But the cause of the Scottish bishops was best served by the disputes
of the English metropolitans, as the archbishop of Canterbury opposed
the pretensions of his own see to the rival claims of York;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> and
Henry, foreseeing that he would be called upon to decide between the
archbishops, and dreading the very idea of another collision with a
churchman, hastily dismissed the Scottish clergy without exacting
from them any admission of canonical dependance upon either see.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
Upon their return to Scotland a deputation immediately set out for
Rome,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and in the course of the same year an injunction was
obtained from the pope forbidding the archbishop of York to press his
claims except before the Roman Court:<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> and twelve years later the
dispute was finally set at rest by the declaration of Pope Clement
III., that the Church of Scotland was in immediate dependance upon the
see of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>But the difficulties of William were not confined to ecclesiastical
disputes, for the confusion amongst the Scottish army, after
his capture at Alnwick, was only precursory of the anarchy, and
disorganization, prevailing in the remoter provinces of his dominions
for several years afterwards. Conspicuous amongst the disturbed
districts was Galloway, for the alliance between the brothers, who
were lords of the province, lasted only as long as it was their mutual
interest to unite for the overthrow of the Scottish supremacy. The
king’s officers, or <i>Maors</i>, <span class="sni">A. D. 1174.</span> who appear
to have been paralyzed at the suddenness of the attack, were either
massacred or driven out of the country almost without resistance;
and fourteen years after the conquest of the principality, the royal
authority was eradicated from Galloway, in fewer weeks than it had
taken years to establish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span></p>

<p>It then occurred to the elder brother Gilbert that his father had
suffered no rival to share his dominions; and, after ascertaining the
sentiments of his immediate adherents, he determined upon entrusting
a body of men to his son, Malcolm, with instructions to remove all
impediments from his path to undivided power. The son was worthy of the
father, and surprising the unsuspecting Uchtred in his island home,
he tore out his eyes and tongue, and then, with still more atrocious
barbarity, left him in this state to perish slowly and in agony. So
speedily had this tragedy been enacted, that when Henry dispatched his
chaplain, Roger Hoveden, from Normandy, with directions to put himself
in communication with Robert de Vaux at Carlisle, and to negotiate
with the lords of Galloway about the transfer of their allegiance to
the English crown, the envoys, upon their arrival in Galloway, found
Gilbert sole ruler of the province. He entered with eagerness upon the
subject of their mission, guaranteeing a yearly tribute of two thousand
marks of silver, and a thousand head of cattle and hogs, if Henry would
release him from his dependance upon the king of Scotland; but as the
envoys possessed no power to conclude an arrangement without submitting
the terms to Henry, they could only promise to lay the proposal before
their king, and, with this reply, they took their leave. <span class="sni">
23d Nov.</span> As it was late in November before they reached Galloway,
by the time they returned to Normandy the convention of Falaise must
have been decided upon, if it had not been already completed; and as
the clause accepting the homage of William for Galloway precluded
Henry from entering into a separate agreement with Gilbert, he availed
himself of the crime of the latter as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span> excuse for breaking off
the negotiations, and for refusing to treat upon any terms with the
murderer of “his cousin Uchtred.”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1175.</div>

<p>Immediately after the conclusion of the ceremony at York, Henry granted
license to William to march an army into Galloway, empowering him to
seek out and seize the murderer, and bring him before the court of his
liege lord for punishment.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Gilbert submitted without resistance;
and, in the autumn of the following year, William again presented
himself at the court of Henry, <span class="sni">A. D. 1176.</span> with the lord
of Galloway in his suite; but a fine seems to have been considered as
a sufficient atonement for fratricide, and, upon the 9th of October,
Gilbert swore fealty to the English king, giving up his eldest son
Duncan as a hostage for his allegiance, and purchasing the royal favour
at the price of a thousand marks of silver. No sooner had he returned
to his principality than, driving out of the province all who were
not of native origin, he denounced the penalty of death against every
true-born Galwegian who dared to acknowledge that he held his lands
of the king of Scots. His hatred against William was intense, and as
no fear ever seems to have crossed his mind that he might forfeit the
newly acquired favour of Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span> by hostilities against his subject and
ally, until the day of his death the Galwegian prince never omitted
an opportunity of harassing and plundering the neighbouring provinces
of Scotland; nor did his estimate of Henry’s character prove to be
incorrect.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Few kings who lived in that age were fortunate enough to escape a
collision with the Church of Rome, nor was William destined to be
amongst the number. His quarrel with Pope Alexander III. arose out
of a dispute connected with the bishopric of St. Andrews. Upon the
death of Bishop Richard in 1178 the chapter elected John Scot to
the vacant see; but the king, who had destined the bishopric for
his own confessor Hugh, and was not accustomed to be dictated to in
matters of church patronage, ordered his nominee to be installed and
consecrated by the Scottish bishops, <span class="sni">A. D. 1180.</span> whilst
the pope, espousing the opposite side, commissioned his legate, the
sub-deacon Alexis, to consecrate John. Yielding to the advice of his
clergy, William offered no opposition to this proceeding, but he swore
by the arm of St. James—his favourite oath—that the same kingdom
should not hold himself and John Scot, and after the conclusion of
the ceremony he effectually frustrated the intentions of the pope
by banishing John, with his uncle Matthew, bishop of Aberdeen, and
all his relations, from the country. Alexander, highly exasperated,
retaliated by threatening to extinguish the liberties of the Scottish
Church which he had hitherto protected, and he engaged the king of
England to interfere in his behalf, conferring the office of legate for
Scotland upon the archbishop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span> York, and authorizing that prelate to
excommunicate William, and to lay his dominions under an interdict if
he still persisted in his determination. <span class="sni">A. D. 1181.</span> It was
in vain that Henry summoned William to Normandy, where the banished
prelates had taken refuge, and endeavoured to effect an arrangement.
The king steadily refused to permit John Scot to enjoy the bishopric
of St. Andrews, offering to appoint him to the chancellorship, with
a promise of the first see that fell vacant in his dominions; and as
the pope determined with equal firmness that none but John Scot should
preside over the contested diocese, refusing to listen to any sort of
compromise, every one who acknowledged Hugh was excommunicated by the
papal legate, whilst all who denied his claim were banished by the king.</p>

<p>Such was the state of Scotland towards the close of the year 1181,
when, to the unfeigned delight of William, he was unexpectedly released
from his difficulties by the deaths of the aged pope and of Roger,
archbishop of York, the inveterate opponent of the liberties of the
Scottish Church. The bishop of Glasgow and the abbot of Melrose
were commissioned to set out immediately for Rome, for the purpose
of negotiating an arrangement with the new pope; and Lucius III.,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1182.</span> reversing the policy of his predecessor,
absolved William from the excommunication, released his kingdom from
the interdict, and forwarded to him the Golden Rose in token of
amity.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> It was subsequently agreed that both bishops, resigning
their sees, should be reinstated by the pope, Hugh retaining the
bishopric of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span> Andrews, and John Scot receiving Dunkeld; and though
six years elapsed before the dispute was brought to a final close,
after the death of Alexander no serious misunderstanding arose between
the king of Scotland and the papal see.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1181.</div>

<p>During the absence of William in Normandy, whilst he was in attendance
at the court of Henry upon the subject of his dispute with the
papal see, some of the leading nobility of Scotland—probably of
<i>Moravia</i>—taking advantage of the distracted state of the
kingdom, made overtures to Donald Bane, a son of William Fitz Duncan,
inviting him to assert his claim upon the throne of Scotland. This
Donald, better known as Mac William, had already put forward his
pretensions to the Scottish crown, but his attempts had been hitherto
limited to predatory incursions, nor had he ever yet obtained a
permanent footing in the country; but the old spirit of disaffection
still lingered in the north and west, where the enemies of the king
flocked to the standard of his hostile kinsman as readily as they
had once gathered around the banner of the heir of Moray, and the
insurrection soon rose to a formidable head.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span> his return
to England towards the close of July, William received intelligence
of the invasion of Donald Bane, but it was not until the middle of
September that he obtained the permission of Henry to absent himself
with his attendant barons from the English court, and to take measures
for the defence of his kingdom. He at once hurried with his brother
David toward the provinces in possession of the enemy, but Mac William
appears to have avoided an encounter, and the king was obliged to
remain satisfied with strengthening his hold upon the marches and
lowlands of Ross-shire, and confining his enemy to the remoter
Highland districts, by the erection of the two castles of Eddirton and
Dunscath.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Although he was now released from the interdict, William found too
much occupation, in attending to the internal dissensions of his own
kingdom, to attempt any interference in the quarrels between Henry and
his sons. Mac William in the north was still unsubdued, whilst Gilbert
of Galloway openly invaded the Lothians, plundering the country,
massacring the inhabitants, and refusing to listen to any terms of
accommodation. <span class="sni">A. D. 1184.</span> Such was the state of disorder
created by the Galwegians, that in the year 1184 William had assembled
an army to repress the outrages of Gilbert, when the return of Henry
from Normandy induced him to alter his intentions, and, dismissing his
followers, he hastened southwards to meet the English king. Mingled
motives may have dictated this change of purpose, though, as a vassal
of the English crown, he was not strictly justified in avenging himself
upon another vassal without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> license of his superior; but at this
time particularly, he was anxious to avoid every cause of quarrel with
Henry, for the Duchess of Saxony had arrived in the train of her father
from Normandy, and William was a suitor for the hand of her daughter
Matilda. Simon de St. Liz also, upon whom the Honor of Huntingdon had
been conferred, had lately died without an heir, and the Scottish king
was equally on his guard lest any misunderstanding should interfere
with his claims upon his former fief.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Henry readily promised his consent to the proposed union if a papal
dispensation could be obtained, but though the relationship was
somewhat distant—for Matilda was eight degrees removed from William
according to the old computation of the civil law, though only four by
the later canonical method of reckoning—the pope refused compliance,
and from subsequent occurrences it is not improbable that Henry was
secretly opposed to the marriage. As a set off to the failure of
his suit with Matilda, the forfeiture of Huntingdon was reversed,
and though several of the English barons put forward pretensions to
the fief, <span class="sni">A. D. 1185.</span> offering large sums of money for
its possession, it was restored by Henry to the Scottish king, who
immediately sub-infeoffed it to his brother David.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>The renewal of the grant of Huntingdon was decided upon at a council
held at London in the middle of Lent 1185, at which the king of
Scotland and his nobility were in attendance, to consult upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span> a
letter which had been received from Pope Lucius respecting the relief
of Jerusalem.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> William had been recently released from one of his
bitterest and most implacable foes, for Gilbert of Galloway had died
in the preceding January. Duncan, the heir of the deceased lord, was
still residing at the court of England in his original capacity of a
hostage; but a competitor for the principality had already arisen in
Roland, the eldest son of the murdered Uchtred, who had now passed ten
years in exile at the Scottish court, where he had married Helena, the
daughter and heiress of the Constable—the same Richard de Moreville
who had been included in the excommunication of William for his
staunch adherence to the cause of his royal master. Roland, therefore,
was attached to the connection with Scotland both by interest and
inclination; he was a Scot rather than a Galwegian, and in his
attempt to recover the inheritance of his father he was assisted by a
numerous band of auxiliaries from the kingdom in which he had so long
resided.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">4th July.</div>

<p>The summer found him in Galloway, entering upon a course of brilliant
and unchequered success. Gillepatrick, Henry Kennedy, and Samuel, the
partners of the late lord in his hostilities against Scotland, and
the leaders of the faction now in arms to secure the succession of
his son, were one after the other defeated and slain: a similar fate
was in store for Gillecolum, who appears to have held the lands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
Gilbert against either claimant, but of whom little else is known
except his incessant ravages of the Lothians; and further resistance
was soon crushed out by the vigorous measures of Roland, who inflicted
summary vengeance on all who refused to acknowledge his authority. His
residence in Scotland had converted him into a feudal baron, and he
lost no time in securing the submission of the province by rebuilding,
and garrisoning, the royal castles which had been destroyed by the sons
of Fergus, on their return after the catastrophe at Alnwick.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Intelligence of Roland’s proceedings must have reached Henry in the
course of the same year, but he passed them over without notice until
his return from Normandy, <span class="sni">A. D. 1186.</span> when, shortly after
Christmas, William and his barons were again in attendance at the court
of England. They were treated by Henry with the most marked and studied
courtesy, for it was his object to prepare them for the marriage which
he had projected between Ermengarde de Bellomont and William; and the
anxiety of Henry to conclude a union which would confer no increase of
political importance upon his royal vassal, strengthens the supposition
that he had looked unfavourably upon the alliance with Matilda of
Saxony. Such thoughts may have passed through the mind of William,
for he delayed his final consent to Henry’s proposal until after a
lengthened conference with his barons, who were possibly influenced in
favour of the projected marriage by the prospect of regaining, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
dowry of their future queen, the important castle of Edinburgh.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>As the grand object of Henry was now attained, he was at liberty to
turn his attention to the affairs of Galloway; and accordingly he
directed William, on his return to Scotland, to summon the new lord
of the province to repair to the English court, for the purpose of
rendering an account of his conduct in entering upon the lands of
Duncan, and other barons of Galloway, seizing upon their castles, and
disposing of their possessions without any reference to his suzerain.
Roland took no further notice of the summons than to strengthen the
natural defences of the country by felling trees in the passes, and by
endeavouring, in various other ways, to render the approaches to the
province impassable for an invading force. But Henry was in earnest,
and he concentrated the whole military force of England on Carlisle,
where he was met by the Scottish contingent under William and his
brother David, whom he deputed to bring Roland to his presence. They
returned at first without success, for the lord of Galloway appears
to have been reluctant to entrust himself within the power of Henry
without some pledge for his safety; but after a second mission, in
which the bishop of Durham and Ranulph de Glanville were associated
with the former envoys, and empowered to give hostages for his security
and safe conduct, Roland placed himself in the hands of the Scottish
princes, and was presented by William to the English king. It was not
the object of the latter to proceed to extremities, for as long as the
lord of Galloway admitted his dependance upon the English crown, it was
immaterial to Henry by whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span> the fief was held; and he was satisfied
with accepting the allegiance which Roland tendered for his father’s
lands, with his promise to abide by the decision of the English court
respecting the claims of his cousin Duncan. The three sons of the
Galwegian chieftain were then delivered over as hostages for the
fidelity of their father; William, his brother, and his barons bound
themselves on oath to enforce the adherence of Roland, if necessary, to
his English allegiance; and as a further security against a breach of
faith, the bishop of Glasgow promised, upon the relics of the saints,
to fulminate against the prince, if he proved a traitor, all the pains
and penalties incurred by a disobedient son of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Such was the conclusion of the disturbances of Galloway, and from the
date of this arrangement Roland remained in undisputed possession of
the whole principality. It is impossible to say whether Duncan ever
prosecuted his claim upon his paternal inheritance; but, immediately
upon the death of Henry, William, who had all along been favourable to
Roland, conferred the district of Carrick as an earldom upon Duncan, on
condition that the new earl should resign all claims upon the lordship
of his cousin.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> In this arrangement Duncan willingly acquiesced,
thus becoming the first possessor of the Earldom of Carrick, a
fief which was destined once more to revert to the crown, when the
illustrious great-grandson of the first earl ascended the throne of
Scotland as Robert the First. Ere long William reaped the full benefit
of having secured a firm and devoted adherent in Roland of Galloway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>Upon his return from this expedition, Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span> celebrated the marriage
of William and Ermengarde with much pomp and ceremony, placing the
palace of Woodstock at the disposal of the royal pair. After four
days spent in feasting and revelry, the young queen departed for her
husband’s kingdom, the earl of Huntingdon escorting her, with the rest
of the Scottish nobility who had been present at the celebration of the
marriage; whilst William, instead of attending upon his bride in her
progress to the north, accompanied the English king to Marlborough.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1187.</div>

<p>Six years had now elapsed since the establishment of Mac William
in the country, where his influence and power had increased to a
formidable extent, and the affairs of the north began to assume an
alarming aspect. The majority of the barons and thanes of Ross, and
other portions of <i>Moravia</i>, had by this time ranged themselves
beneath his banner;<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> whilst the connection of the lords of
Argyle, and the Isles, with the family of Malcolm Mac Heth, must have
disposed the leading nobles of the Western Highlands to display a very
lukewarm adherence to the royal cause. With the greater part of the
north and west either openly, or secretly, in his favour, Mac William
could also calculate upon the support of many other leading men, who
had been parties to his first establishment in the country; and the
king perceived that a crisis had at length arrived, in which he must
either immediately crush his competitor, or risk the loss of half his
kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, in the summer of 1187, all the military force of
Scotland which had not openly declared for Mac William, was ordered
to concentrate upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span> Inverness; and William contemplated placing
himself at the head of his army, following his rival into the remoter
Highlands, and forcing him to a decisive contest, about the result
of which he entertained little doubt. Many of his barons, however,
who were alive to the dangers of the impending campaign in a wild and
mountainous region, vehemently opposed the royal project, dreading the
repetition of some disastrous accident from the fiery and impetuous
courage of the king. They were uneasy, also, about the fidelity
of a certain portion of the royal army, who were quite as well
inclined to favour Mac William as to support the cause of the king;
and, acquiescing at length in the prudence of their advice, William
consented to remain at Inverness, and to entrust the immediate conduct
of the war to leaders upon whose ability and fidelity he could depend.</p>

<p>A fresh difficulty arose, after the king’s decision, from the positive
refusal of some of his principal nobles to march without the king
against Mac William. At a moment of such vital importance to the royal
cause, when the exertions of the well-affected were paralysed by this
unexpected sedition, the eyes of all the army were turned upon the Lord
of Galloway; and it was well for William that, in this crisis, he could
count upon the fidelity of that powerful baron.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> No hesitation
marked the conduct of Roland, who at once threw the whole weight of his
influence and authority upon the side of his royal master; and when,
in consequence of the dispute, it was arranged that the main body of
the army should remain with William at Inverness, placing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span> at
the head of three thousand of his own followers, upon whose fidelity he
could depend, he set out in search of Mac William, in the determination
of carrying out in person the original intentions of the king.</p>

<p>The fate of Scotland was decided by an accident; and it has twice been
the destiny of Inverness to witness, in its vicinity, the termination
of a contest for a crown. Upon the moor of Mamgarvy, some long
forgotten spot in that neighbourhood, the party of Roland unexpectedly
fell in with a body of the enemy, whose numbers were about equal to
their own. Neither party shunned the contest, but the royalists gained
the day, and amongst the slain was discovered the lifeless body of
Mac William. His death terminated the war, and the victor returned in
triumph to Inverness, to earn the grant of the broad lands of Galloway
with the head of his royal master’s most formidable and inveterate
opponent.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The death of Donald Bane at once restored peace throughout the north
of Scotland. The strength of his cause had lain, not so much in the
devotion of his adherents to his own person, as in their disaffection
towards the reigning sovereign; and the same feelings which had
induced many of the Scottish nobles to look with indifference upon the
increase of Donald’s power, rendered them equally careless about its
extinction. No enthusiastic clansmen burned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span> avenge the slaughter
of their chief; for no hereditary attachment united his followers to
Mac William, like the feelings which once bound the men of Moray to the
descendants of their early kings and mormaors.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The cause of Mac
Heth was identified with the claims of the ancient line of Kenneth Mac
Duff; but the powerful chieftains of the North and West, who adhered to
that family from hereditary associations, must have followed the banner
of Mac William from enmity to the reigning family, or from dislike to
their feudal innovations, rather than from any clannish feeling of
attachment to the heir of Malcolm Ceanmore’s eldest son, who claimed to
be the rightful representative of the rival line of Atholl.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1188.</div>

<p>Scotland had at this period almost regained the position in which she
stood before the fatal capture of her king. Galloway was at length
pacified, the north and west were no longer in open rebellion, and
Scottish men-at-arms once more garrisoned the castle of Edinburgh; but
Henry still retained Roxburgh and Berwick, the keys of the southern
frontier, and for the cession of these important fortresses William
offered to pay 4000 marks of silver. Henry signified his readiness
to restore the castles if William, in return, would agree to grant
him the tenths of the kingdom of Scotland for the projected crusade,
an arrangement to which the latter promised to consent, if he could
prevail upon his people to give their sanction to the terms; but
when the bishop of Durham, who was deputed by his king to collect
the promised aid, arrived for this purpose upon the frontiers of
Scotland, he was met between Werk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span> and Brigham by the Scottish king,
who unexpectedly prohibited his further advance. William renewed
his original offer for the castles, explaining to the bishop, that,
personally, he was still ready to adhere to his compact with Henry;
but that upon assembling his barons and clergy in council, they had
unanimously refused to listen to the arrangement, asserting that they
would refuse to grant away the tenths of Scotland, though both kings
had sworn to levy them in person. In vain the English envoy attempted
to turn the Scots from their purpose; threats and persuasion were
equally unavailing, for the determination of the latter was inflexible;
and as the bishop was not empowered to take into consideration the
propositions of the Scottish king, he was obliged to return empty
handed to the south, and convey to his master in Normandy the impotent
result of his mission.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1189.</div>

<p>In the following year the ingratitude of his favourite son John, for
whose sake he had provoked the hostility of Richard, by evading the
acknowledgment of the latter as his rightful successor, completed the
ruin that fatigue and chagrin had commenced, and, early in July, Henry
of England died of a broken heart at Chinon. Earl David appears to have
been implicated in the rebellion of Richard, for Huntingdon was amongst
the fiefs granted by the latter at Tours, upon the day after the army
of the confederates was enabled, through the continued drought, to
enter that town by fording the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span> shallow Loire.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The death of Henry
was fraught with most important consequences for Scotland, for Richard,
with all the enthusiasm of his impetuous nature, was burning to lead
the chivalry of Europe to the re-conquest of the Holy Sepulchre, and
as money was most essential for carrying out the crusade, in every
imaginable method he sought to procure it. The great offices of the
crown were put up for sale; the favour of the king was purchased by
his illegitimate brother Geoffry; and the earldom of Northumberland
was bought by the bishop of Durham.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Ten thousand marks of silver
were paid by William as the price of the independence of his kingdom
and of the restoration of the castles of Roxburgh and Berwick; and
in the following November, about six weeks after the coronation of
Richard, at which the earl of Huntingdon had assisted, bearing one
of the swords of state, the archbishop of York, with the sheriff and
barons of the shire, met William at the Tweed, and in obedience to the
commands of their sovereign, escorted him with every mark of honour to
Canterbury. Here upon the 5th of December, after duly performing “such
homage for his English dignities as his ancestors were wont to render
to the predecessors of the English king,” he received from the hands of
Richard a charter annulling all the concessions extorted by Henry at
the time of his capture; and after fifteen years of feudal subjection,
the consequences of the disastrous accident at Alnwick were at length
repaired, and the independence of Scotland re-established.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<span class="subhed sm">WILLIAM THE LION—1165–1214.</span></h2></div>

<p>Peace reigned throughout the northern borders of England during the
absence of her king in the Holy Land; and when Richard languished in
the dungeons of the emperor, William contributed two thousand marks
towards his ransom. <span class="sni">A. D. 1193.</span> No countenance was afforded
by the Scottish sovereign to the intrigues of Philip and John; but upon
the release of the royal captive, Earl David of Huntingdon was the
first to declare in his favour, and uniting with the Earl of Chester,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1194.</span> whose sister he had married, he joined in
besieging the strong castle of Nottingham on behalf of the liberated
king.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Early in April, and shortly after the Council of Nottingham, William
met the king of England at Clipston, passing the remainder of the month
in his company. He soon found an opportunity for urging a restoration
of the dignities and honors which had belonged, as he maintained, to
his predecessors, putting forward a formal claim upon the earldom of
Northumberland, and the Honor of Lancaster, together with the counties
of Cumberland and Westmoreland—the whole territory, in short, which
had once been held by his father, Earl Henry. Richard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span> returned an
evasive answer, alleging that he must consult his barons: and after
the council held at Northampton, in Easter week, he replied that, in
his present circumstances, it was impossible to listen to William’s
demands; as concession on his part would be attributed to his fear of
the French war, rather than to his affection for the Scottish king. As
a set off to a reply which was tantamount to a refusal, he conferred
upon William a charter of privileges, specifying that whenever the
king of Scotland attended the English court, the whole of his expenses
should be defrayed out of the English exchequer; and providing that he
should be escorted, both in arriving and on his return, by the bishops
and sheriffs of the different dioceses and counties, through which it
was necessary for him to pass in the course of his progress. William
was obliged to be satisfied with this concession; and he assisted, in
token of amity, at the second coronation of Richard, bearing, upon this
occasion, the principal sword of state.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Another opportunity soon occurred for again advancing his claims. After
the conclusion of the coronation, the bishop of Durham resigned his
earldom of Northumberland into the hands of Richard, and the king was
on the point of transferring it to Hugo Bardolf, when William hastened
to offer 15,000 marks for the fief. The magnitude of the sum tempted
Richard, who was seldom proof against an offer of this description,
and, after a short deliberation, he consented to grant the earldom
without the castles—or, in other words, the pecuniary, but not the
political, advantages of the fief—a compromise which did not accord
with the views of William. He made a final effort to obtain his object
a few days before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> departure of Richard for Normandy, but equally
without success, for the latter would only hold out the hope that
he might take the matter into consideration on his return from his
expedition into France; and the Scottish king, towards the close of the
month, retraced his steps towards the north in bitter chagrin at his
failure.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1195.</div>

<p>In the course of the following year, William was seized with an
alarming illness at Clackmannan, and, in the momentary expectation of
death, assembling his leading nobles, he made known his intention of
declaring as his successor Otho of Saxony, a son of Henry the Lion, and
subsequently emperor of Germany, on the stipulation that the prince
should marry his eldest daughter Margaret. The proposal was but coldly
received by many of his nobility; Earl Patrick of Dunbar, as the
spokesman of the dissentient party, maintaining that it was contrary
to the custom of Scotland for the crown to descend in the female line,
as long as there was a brother, or nephew, in the succession.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
The question was terminated for the time by the recovery of the king;
but he did not relinquish his purpose, and, at Christmas, he gave an
audience at York to the archbishop of Canterbury, who was empowered
by Richard to conduct the negotiations connected with the marriage in
question. Lothian was to be the dowry of the Scottish princess, and
the castles of that province were to be made over to the keeping of
the English king; whilst Richard engaged to bestow the earldoms of
Carlisle and Northumberland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span> upon his nephew the Saxon prince, and to
place all the castles of those fiefs in the hands of William.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> But
this convention was never destined to be carried out; the return of
health, and the hopes of an heir, induced William to procrastinate; and
the reasons which influenced him in entering upon the negotiation were
finally removed, three years afterwards, when his queen presented him
with a son.</p>

<p>It was in the year following this abortive negotiation about the
marriage of his eldest daughter with the Prince of Saxony, that the
attention of the king was directed to renewed commotions in the north;
but, to explain the origin of these disturbances, it will be necessary
to revert once more to the history of the Orkneys.</p>

<p>Paul and Erlend, the joint earls, who were deposed and sent prisoners
to Norway by Magnus Barefoot, never revisited their native land. They
died in exile; <span class="sni">A. D. 1199.</span> and about two years after Magnus
lost his life in Ireland, Hacon, the son of Paul, who had rendered good
service in the Irish expedition, <span class="sni">A. D. 1105.</span> obtained from
the sons of the deceased king a grant of the earldom of the Orkneys.
The sons of Erlend had been also carried off by the Norwegian king; but
Magnus Erlendson, taking advantage of a moment, when he was unobserved,
to plunge into the sea, swam to the neighbouring shore of Scotland, and
thus escaped; whilst his brother Erlend, who remained on board, lost
his life subsequently in battle.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>Magnus Erlendson remained quietly at the Court of Scotland until the
departure of Sigurd Magnusson for Norway, when he sailed for the
Orkneys to claim his share in the earldom. Hacon viewed his arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
with displeasure, but as the feeling of the islanders was in favour
of his cousin, he consented to abide by the decision of the Norwegian
Court, and Magnus was shortly afterwards confirmed in the possession
of his father’s portion of the earldom. Little cordiality existed
between the earls, and they were at length upon the brink of an open
rupture, when it was agreed that they should meet upon the small
islet of Egillsey for the arrangement of their mutual differences. To
this spot, accordingly, Magnus repaired upon the appointed day, and,
faithful to the conditions of the meeting, he brought with him only a
few unarmed friends. Hacon arrived soon afterwards with a squadron of
eight ships, filled with the rovers of the sea; and as the armed crews
stepped upon the shore, the son of Erlend foresaw his doom. He met it
with fortitude and resignation; his head was severed from his body; and
the islanders, horror stricken at the perfidious murder, long venerated
their favourite earl as a martyr and a saint.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Success affording leisure for repentance, Hacon sought to expiate his
crime by a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; and upon his death, some years
afterwards, the earldom was divided between his two sons by different
marriages, who were known respectively as Paul the Silent, and Harald
the Eloquent. The latter, who was the younger, appears in some of the
Scottish charters as earl of Caithness, a province which then, and
long afterwards, seems to have extended as far as Dingwall.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The
usual jealousy existed between the brothers, ceasing only with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
life of Harald, who is said to have met his death in a mysterious
and unaccountable manner, and, as was generally supposed, through
wearing, by mistake, a poisoned garment intended for his half-brother
Paul, who was an object of hatred and aversion to Helga and her sister
Frakarka, the mother and aunt of Harald. The opportunity was not lost
upon the surviving earl, who, very easily convinced of the guilt of
Helga, banished her immediately from the islands. Her brother Ottir
was lord of Thurso, and her sister also held large possessions on the
mainland. To them accordingly she repaired, with her grandson Erlend
Haroldson and her daughter Margaret, who was soon afterwards married
to Madach, Earl of Atholl, one of the greatest nobles of the day, and
a first cousin of David, who, at this period, occupied the throne of
Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Earl Paul was not destined to hold for any length of time undisputed
possession of the whole earldom, for a competitor arose in the person
of a descendant, and heir to the claims, of Erlend Thorfinson. In one
of his numerous conflicts in the western seas, Magnus Barefoot lost
an attached and faithful follower of the name of Kali, upon whose son
he conferred large possessions in the Orkneys and elsewhere, with the
hand of Gunhilda, the daughter of the elder Erlend. Gunhilda, after
the death of her brothers, became the heiress of her father’s rights;
and it was her son who now demanded his share of the earldom from the
surviving son of Hacon. His real name was Kol, the same as that of his
father, but he assumed the name of Rognwald, which was popular amongst
the Orkneymen, from his supposed resemblance to Rognwald Brusison,
who is said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span> have still lingered in the recollection of an aged
Norwegian queen as the handsomest man of her time.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Paul refused to listen to the claims of Rognwald, though they were
supported by the authority of the Court of Norway; but Frakarka and
her sister Helga willingly agreed to further his cause, promising to
attack the earl from the mainland, whilst Rognwald assailed him from
the sea. But Paul was on the alert, holding his ground successfully
against both attacks; nor was it until some years later that Rognwald,
to whom the Shetlanders steadily adhered, <span class="sni">A. D. 1135.</span> was
enabled to extend his authority over the whole of the Orkneys, through
the surprise and capture of Paul by the contrivance of the Earl of
Atholl.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>The first step taken by the new earl was to identify his cause with the
memory of his murdered uncle, whose aid had been invoked in support
of the second and successful expedition. Policy as well as gratitude
suggested that the fortunate result should be attributed to the
intervention of the popular martyr, and Rognwald vowed that a lasting
monument should hand down the remembrance of his murdered kinsman,
and commemorate, at the same time, the manner in which the saint had
interfered in his own behalf. In accordance with his vow a stately
cathedral church arose at Kirkwall, which was dedicated in honour of
St. Magnus; but it was a work far beyond the means of the earl, and to
further its completion, he was obliged to restore their rights to the
Odallers, who were permitted to regain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span> their ancient privileges on
payment of a large contribution in aid of the building.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime the luckless Paul was conducted to the residence of the
Earl of Atholl by his captor Sweyne Asleifason, a powerful nobleman of
Caithness at feud with the earl on account of his banishment from the
Orkneys. Here he was treated with the most ceremonious courtesy. The
chair of state was resigned to him by Madach; the beautiful Margaret,
surrounded by her ladies, received him with the cordial welcome of a
sister; mummers and jesters relieved the monotony of the hour; and in
the true spirit of northern hospitality the evening was devoted to
drinking. Thus passed the leisure time of a Scottish nobleman in the
twelfth century, when he was not engaged in the more stirring pursuits
of war, or of the chase. One thing alone reminded the deposed earl
of the real position in which he stood—the doors were invariably
locked.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>Paul long maintained his reputation for taciturnity, but at length he
appears to have spoken, and to the purpose; <span class="sni">A. D. 1137.</span>
for two years after the accession of Rognwald, whilst that earl was
celebrating with his friends some festive occasion in the month of
July, their attention was attracted by the arrival of a vessel from
the south with a venerable personage on board, whose purple cloak
and quaintly trimmed beard aroused the curiosity of the Orkneymen,
until the earl’s chaplain pronounced the mysterious stranger to be a
Scottish bishop.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> He was received with every mark of respect, and
subsequently escorted to Egillsey, the residence of William, Bishop of
the Orkneys; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span> the result of a conference between Rognwald and the
two prelates was the admission of the claim of Harald Mac Madach to his
uncle’s share in the earldom, in virtue of the resignation of Paul. The
rights of Harald, then a child between four and five years of age, were
confirmed at an amicable meeting, held in Caithness, by the leading
chieftains of Atholl and the Orkneys, representing “the communities”
of the respective earldoms;<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1138.</span> and, in the
following spring, he was consigned to the charge of Earl Rognwald,
though his real supporters appear to have been Sweyne Asleifason and
Thorbiorn, a grandson of Frakarka, married to the sister of Sweyne, and
guardian to the youthful earl.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1153.</div>

<p>Fifteen years elapsed without any diminution in the friendship of
Rognwald for his youthful colleague; Madach and his royal cousin sunk
into the grave; and the elder earl departed for the Holy Land, leaving
Harald in charge of the earldom.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The same year witnessed the last
expedition, in which a Norwegian king enacted the part of a pirate in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span> western seas; Eystein, in a time of profound peace, inflicting
upon the unoffending inhabitants of the English and Scottish coasts
a repetition of the ravages of his heathen predecessors. Amongst the
sufferers was Harald, who was surprised and captured off Thurso, but he
regained his liberty at the price of several marks “in gold,” and an
acknowledgment of his dependance upon Norway;<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> though he was less
fortunate some years later, when his cousin Erlend Haraldson arrived to
claim his share in the earldom. Erlend, who appears to have succeeded
to the authority of his uncle, Ottir of Thurso, had taken advantage
of the absence of Rognwald to obtain from the youthful king of
Scotland, Malcolm the Fourth, a confirmation of his right to the half
of Caithness, and he now demanded a similar division of the islands.
Harald demurred to his claims unless they were confirmed by the Court
of Norway, nor would he consent to acknowledge Erlend as his colleague,
even after his rights were recognized by the Norwegian kings, till the
defection of Sweyne Asleifason forced from him a reluctant acquiescence
in this arrangement. Not content with depriving Harald of half the
earldom, Erlend carried off the Earl’s mother, the still beautiful
Margaret, bearing her to that singular fort of Mousa, in the Shetland
Isles, of which the remains still exist to excite the curiosity of
modern times; where he defended his prize with such tenacity, that he
forced Harald to consent to their marriage, and this singular union of
a nephew with his aunt is related in the Saga without a comment!<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span></p>

<p>After a lengthened absence in the Holy Land, Rognwald returned from
Palestine to find Erlend established in his place. In this dilemma the
Bonders were assembled, whose unanimous verdict pronounced Rognwald
to be the lawful representative of one line of their rulers; and as
it then remained for them to determine which of the other earls was
entitled to the remaining share in the islands, their decision was
given in favour of Erlend. Their award was probably just, but Harald
could hardly be expected to acquiesce in it. Retiring to the mainland
he sought the assistance of his kinsmen, and when he reappeared in
the Orkneys in the following spring, Rognwald immediately declared in
favour of his early friend. But the redoubtable Sweyne Asleifason, who
espoused the side of Erlend, long upheld the cause of the latter earl,
by his courage and counsels, until the confederates, watching their
opportunity, surprised and slew their rival whilst he was stupified
by the effects of his potations.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Rognwald did not long survive
their victory, falling a victim to the revenge of Thorbiorn, the
former guardian of Harald, <span class="sni">A. D. 1158.</span> who waylaid and
assassinated the earl whilst hunting in the dales of Caithness. His
surviving colleague conveyed the body to Thurso, from whence, after a
lapse of thirty years, <span class="sni">A. D. 1188.</span> it was removed to the
cathedral church of Kirkwall, when the name of the murdered Rognwald
was enrolled in the Calendar of the Saints.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>In this manner Harald found himself, at the age of five and twenty, in
undisputed possession of the earldoms of Caithness and the Orkneys.
In appearance, as well as in character, he must have resembled his
maternal ancestor Thorfin; for, like that earl, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span> is described as
“tall, strong, and hard-featured,”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and he raised his power, by
his talents and military prowess, to a height unprecedented since the
days of his formidable predecessor. To Sweyne Asleifason, his early
friend and subsequent opponent, he appears to have been thoroughly
reconciled. Sweyne was a genuine type of the chieftain of that era, a
veritable representative of that numerous class which viewed, with such
suspicious jealousy, the curtailment of their lawless liberty by the
introduction of a novel system of government. The spring and autumn he
dedicated to agriculture; a scanty crop was rudely sown and as rudely
gathered in: the summer was devoted to a course of piracy; and the
winter was spent in revelry. Such were still the habits of life amongst
the chieftains of the north and west of Scotland; and in earlier times,
as in Scandinavia and Northern Germany, the practice had been similar
throughout the whole country, with the sole difference, that the
dwellers upon the coasts were rovers by sea, and the inhabitants of the
interior were plunderers by land.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>For nearly forty years Harald remained in the contented enjoyment of
his two earldoms, acknowledging a nominal dependence upon the crowns
of Scotland and Norway, but in all other respects as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span> untrammelled as
the most independent of his maternal ancestors. He was married to a
sister of Duncan, Earl of Fife, and this connection with one of the
firmest partizans of the reigning family may have kept him steady in
his allegiance. At length, at the mature age of sixty and upwards, he
transferred his affections to a daughter of Mac Heth, and he married
the object of his elderly love after divorcing his former wife by
one of those summary processes which lingered latest, with other
barbarisms, in the extreme north. The union was inauspicious, as might
have been expected; a daughter of Mac Heth could not fail to remind
her husband of her hereditary claims upon Moray, and, yielding too
readily to the suggestions of ambition, ere long Harald seized upon the
province.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1196</div>

<p>It was the intelligence of these proceedings on the part of the earl
that now brought William in haste from the south; for he had already
suffered too much from such a cause to think lightly of a rebellion
in the northern Highlands. Meeting Harald’s son, Thorfin, in the
neighbourhood of Inverness, he defeated him with ease, killing Roderic,
a partizan, apparently, of the family of Mac Heth;<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> whilst Harald
retreated as the king advanced, until at length, despairing of success,
he fled to his ships in the hope of escaping to the Orkneys. But
the earl was doomed to misfortune; an adverse gale detained him in
port, and he was compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> become a reluctant eyewitness of the
destruction of his castle at Thurso, and of the unwonted spectacle of
a royal army ravaging the extremity of Caithness. Submission was now
the only course left open, and he was fain to purchase the withdrawal
of the hostile army by promising to surrender the enemies of the king,
to place his son Thorfin as a hostage in the hands of William for his
own fidelity, and to resign half the earldom of Caithness to Harald
Ericson.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Satisfied with the earl’s concessions, the king withdrew from his
territories; again proceeding northwards as far as Nairn in the
course of the same autumn, to await the fulfilment of the treaty. On
his return from hunting late one evening, he found Earl Harald in
attendance with two children, his nephews, whom he offered in the place
of his own son as hostages for his fidelity and allegiance. Surprised
at this evasion of their agreement, the king demanded the reason of
it, remarking upon the absence of Thorfin, whom Harald had promised as
a hostage. The earl’s reply was remarkable, though it could scarcely
be considered satisfactory. Thorfin, he said, was his only son, and he
was reluctant to part with the sole heir of his earldom; and as for the
enemies of the king whom he had promised to deliver into his hands,
they had actually accompanied him as far as the port of Lochloy, within
a few miles of Nairn, when he had suffered them to escape, reflecting
that their doom was certain if once surrendered to the king.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> As it
is impossible that the earl could have imagined for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span> one moment that
William would permit so palpable an evasion of their treaty, it can
only be supposed that, repenting of his promise as he approached Nairn,
he preferred braving the royal anger by conniving at the escape of his
prisoners, to surrendering friends, and probably connections, of his
own, or of his wife, to the certain doom of death; or the even worse
alternative of perpetual imprisonment, with probable mutilation or loss
of sight. William and his barons in council—the peers of the earl,
before whom he was immediately arraigned—at once pronounced him guilty
of a breach of fealty, declaring that he had thereby forfeited his
liberty; and he was carried in the train of William to the south, and
retained in custody until, upon the arrival of his son Thorfin, he was
released from captivity, and permitted to return to the Orkneys.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1197.</div>

<p>But the earl had not yet reached the conclusion of his troubles;
for Harald Ericson, after receiving a grant of half the earldom of
Caithness from the king of Scotland, sailed to Norway, and obtained a
recognition of his right, from King Suerer, to a similar partition of
the Orkneys. This Harald, generally known as the younger earl, was a
son of Ingigerda, the only child of Rognwald; but the elder Harald,
unmindful of his early friend, seems to have ignored the claims of
his heir to a partition of the earldom. A band of followers, however,
was easily collected in Norway, and so little was the elder earl
prepared for an attack, that, upon the arrival of his competitor in
the Orkneys, he fled precipitately to Man. He was shortly followed by
Harald Ericson; but again eluding pursuit, he returned suddenly to the
Orkneys, visiting with summary vengeance all who had declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span> for the
younger Harald. He had lost no time in the interval in gathering his
own partizans, and, upon the return of his opponent from the Western
Isles, he no longer shrunk from a contest for which he was now fully
prepared.</p>

<p>The rival earls met near Wick, in Caithness; victory declared for the
elder Harald, and the last descendant of Erlend Thorfinson perished
upon the field of his defeat. Availing himself of the protection of
the bishops of Ross and of St. Andrews, the conqueror sought the
Scottish Court, and hastened to offer a large sum for the restitution
of that portion of Caithness which had been conferred upon his deceased
competitor. The king promised his consent if the earl would comply with
his conditions, and agree to take back his former wife, and surrender
Bonaver, the son of Ingemund, together with his chaplain, Lawrence,
as additional hostages for his allegiance. Which of these conditions
was distasteful to the earl the chronicler has failed to specify; but,
in the opinion of Harald, half the earldom of Caithness would have
been too dearly purchased at such a price; and upon the refusal of
the proposed terms, William, without further parley, sold the fief to
Ronald, king of Man.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>According to the usual custom of the age, Ronald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> placed his
<i>Maors</i>, or deputies, over his newly acquired earldom, whilst
Harald, retreating to the Orkneys, busied himself in preparations for
the forcible recovery of his possessions; and suddenly reappearing in
Caithness with an overpowering force, he drove out all who opposed him,
treating the bishop of the diocese with savage cruelty for a supposed
predilection to the cause of his rival.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Although Christmas was
approaching, William lost no time in hastening to the scene of action,
first retaliating the barbarities of the earl upon his unfortunate
hostage Thorfin; but by the time the king reached Caithness, Harald
had escaped to the Orkneys, returning immediately upon the departure
of the royal army. William again marched to the north in the following
spring, and again the earl sought refuge amongst his islands; but as
such a fruitless contest was harassing to both parties, without being
beneficial to either, it was at length terminated by Harald, who,
<span class="sni">A. D. 1202.</span> placing himself under the safe conduct of the
Bishop of St. Andrews, tendered his submission to the king at Perth,
and was permitted, for a sum of 2000 pounds of silver, to enjoy his
earldom in peace during the brief remainder of his life.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1198.</div>

<p>The six years over which these disturbances in the extreme north of
Scotland extended had not been destitute of other events of importance,
for, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span> the 24th of August 1198, the question of the succession to the
Scottish throne had been finally set at rest by the birth of a prince,
to whom the name of Alexander was given. <span class="sni">A. D. 1201</span> Three
years afterwards, according to the usual custom of the age, William
summoned the barons of his realm to swear fealty to his infant heir
at Musselburgh; the Earl of Huntingdon imitating the example of the
Scottish nobles, and performing homage to his youthful nephew about
four years later.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1205</span> By the death of Richard,
in the year following the birth of Alexander, <span class="sni">A. D. 1199</span>
the relations between the English and Scottish kings had once more
become unsettled. Doubt and mistrust overshadowed England, bishops
and barons strengthening their castles, and preparing for the contest
anticipated between the uncle and his nephew; whilst numbers of the
continental vassals of the English crown openly declared for Arthur.
Following the course invariably adopted upon such occasions by all
aspirants to the crown, John possessed himself of the late king’s
treasures at Chinon, and this important point secured, he dispatched
the Archbishop of Canterbury across the Channel, with William the
Mareschal, and Geoffry Fitz Peter, the Justiciary of England,
empowering them to pledge his royal word to all whose allegiance
appeared doubtful, that full justice should be rendered on the arrival
of the king to every faithful adherent of his cause. William, as might
have been expected, had seized upon the opportunity afforded by John’s
uncertain position to revive his claims upon the northern counties;
but the royal deputies, after the council held at Northampton, forbade
the Scottish envoys, who had arrived there, to cross to Normandy,
prevailing upon the Earl of Huntingdon, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span> principal of the
dubious adherents who had been gained over at the recent meeting, to
notify to his royal brother that he should await the arrival of the
king. A similar request was conveyed directly from John by Eustace
de Vesci, who bore a promise to his wife’s father—for Eustace had
married Margaret, one of William’s natural daughters—that complete
satisfaction should be afforded him in all that he sought, if he would
only refrain from immediate hostilities.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>Soon after his coronation upon Ascension day, John gave audience to
William de Hay, and the priors of May and Inchcolm, who, in the name of
the Scottish king, demanded a full restitution of his “patrimony”—the
northern counties; promising liege and faithful service if he gained
his suit, but threatening, in case of refusal, to win his rights by
the sword. The reply of John was characteristically evasive;—“If your
king, my very dear cousin, will come in person, I will do him right in
this and in all that he demands.” The bishop of St. Andrews, with Hugo
Malebise, were made the bearers of this message to William, whilst,
that no point of courtesy or ceremonial might be omitted, the bishop of
Durham was directed to proceed at once to the frontiers and escort the
Scottish king to the place of meeting.</p>

<p>John reached the appointed rendezvous at Nottingham upon Whitsunday,
but the king of Scotland declined to come, only sending word by
Malebise and the bishop that, if his demands were not immediately
granted, he would resent the refusal by a declaration of war. John
stipulated for a further truce of forty days, promising a final answer
at the end of that time; but after collecting a powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span> army,
and placing the counties in question under the charge of William
d’Estoteville, he hastened to embark for Normandy within a fortnight,
leaving the Scottish envoys, who had hurried after him to the coast, to
convey what answer they pleased to their king.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>At length perceiving that the promises of John had been merely
subterfuges for gaining time, William prepared to put his threats
into execution; but the proper season for action had already passed
away, and the English barons, not yet disgusted by the falsehood and
tyranny of John, had for the present declared in his favour. A natural
feeling of anxiety oppressed the mind of William as he recalled the
events of his early manhood, and remembered the consequences of his
former war with England. His kingdom was still unsettled, his health
was beginning to fail, whilst his heir was still a mere child, and
Scotland had hardly yet recovered from the disastrous state of anarchy
into which she had been plunged by the capture of her king at Alnwick.
Impressed with gloomy forebodings, the king determined upon passing the
night by the shrine of his sainted ancestress at Dunfermline; where
his reluctance to engage in hostilities assuming the form of a warning
dream, he dismissed his army on the following morning, assuring them
that he had been forbidden by a heavenly vision to attempt the invasion
of England.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1200.</div>

<p>William had given up all present thoughts of open war, but he refused
to listen to any overtures from John, declining to meet the English
king at York in the following Lent, whilst he cultivated an alliance
with Philip of France, and a marriage was negotiated between the young
prince of Scotland and an infant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span> French princess, the daughter of
Agnes de Meranie.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> The rumour of this alliance seriously alarmed
John, and after the second of his numerous coronations, he dispatched
a distinguished embassy with letters of safe conduct to the borders,
to propose an interview with the king of Scotland, and to escort him
for this purpose to Lincoln. With the Bishop of Durham and the Sheriff
of Northumberland were associated the Earl of Hereford and the Lords
de Vesci and de Ros, the nephew and sons-in-law of William, who, with
the Earls of Huntingdon and Norfolk, and a brilliant retinue of other
barons, awaited the arrival of the Scottish king on the frontiers, and
conducted him, with every mark of respect, to the place of meeting.
Here, upon a neighbouring hill, which was at that time without the city
of Lincoln, William performed homage to John “for his right saving his
own right;” <span class="sni">22d Nov.</span> swearing fealty upon the cross of the
Archbishop of Canterbury—a breach of the usual custom, explained by
one of the chroniclers as arising “because there was no sacred book
at hand.” The question about the northern counties was again brought
forward for discussion, but with no satisfactory result, although a
final decision was again promised at the end of another six months;
and the king of Scotland, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span> had in reality gained nothing beyond
his ordinary feudal advantages by his journey, was obliged to rest
contented with the empty honour of returning to his own kingdom under
the same distinguished escort that had accompanied him to Lincoln.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>The interview between the kings had not been of a nature to promote
any real feeling of cordiality; for William had again proved from
experience that the promises of John were merely empty words, whilst he
had permitted his crafty rival to discover how little real importance
he need attach to the threats of a Scottish war. No more dangerous
knowledge could have been acquired by a prince of such a character
as John, who, in his subsequent transactions with the Scottish king,
turned this backwardness to his own account, evidently presuming upon
the reluctance of William to venture upon the chances of a war.</p>

<p>A rupture, however, had almost occurred through the contemplated
erection of a castle at the mouth of the Tweed, for the purpose of
commanding the Scottish burgh of Berwick, with its important fortress;
thus endangering the prosperity of the foremost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> commercial town in
Scotland, and neutralizing the cession of one of the keys of the
Lothians, restored by the charter of Cœur de Lion. It was impossible
for William to overlook so dangerous an encroachment, and whenever the
English attempted to begin the building, the Scots drove them away by
force, levelling their work with the ground; proceedings which were
more than once repeated, until, upon his return from the disastrous
campaign of 1203, John hastened to the north of England, <span class="sni">A.
D. 1204.</span> where he was met upon the frontiers at Norham by William, who
was hardly recovered from one of those dangerous attacks of illness
to which his advancing years appear to have rendered him liable. The
conference was stormy, and the kings parted in anger; but John was
either too much occupied with the French war to add another to the
list of his open enemies, or he treated the whole affair with his
usual fickle levity, and in spite of the hostile character of their
interview, their kingdoms remained in a state of nominal peace.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>However averse he might have been to risk the chances of hostilities,
William was evidently a very cool friend to England during the next
five years, eagerly testifying his devotion to the papal see when the
interdict was levelled against John, and receiving in return from Pope
Innocent a bull, or rescript, fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span> confirming every liberty and
immunity that had at any time been conferred upon the king, church, or
kingdom of Scotland, by the head of the Roman Church.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> He appears,
also, to have set on foot a negotiation for procuring a foreign
alliance for one of his children;<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> <span class="sni">A. D. 1209.</span> but the
fears of John were by this time aroused, and he marched with an immense
army to the north, in the determination of calling William to account
for destroying his castle at Tweedmouth, for aiming at an alliance with
his open enemies, and for negotiating the intended marriage without
consulting the suzerain of whom he held his English fiefs. To guard
against the chances of invasion, William occupied a strong position
in the neighbourhood of Roxburgh, where he gave audience to the
envoys of John, who, upon reaching Norham, dispatched a safe conduct
to the Scottish king, with a requisition to meet him at Newcastle;
but three days after his arrival at the place of meeting, and before
their conference had resulted in any satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span> conclusion, it was
unexpectedly interrupted by the sudden illness of the Scottish king,
and all further proceedings were broken off after a temporary truce had
been arranged.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>The return of health revived the reluctance of William to yield to
the demands of John, and, after ascertaining the sentiments of his
baronage and clergy in a council held at Stirling, he dispatched the
bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow, with William Comyn and Philip de
Valoniis, the Justiciary and Chamberlain of Scotland, charged with so
decided an answer to the English king, that John’s fury was aroused to
the utmost pitch, and he issued immediate orders for the assemblage of
his army, and the reconstruction of the castle at Tweedmouth. William,
upon learning the result of his embassy, hurried from Forfar towards
the Lothians, deputing the bishop of St. Andrews to convey a qualified
refusal to the incensed John. Arrived at Edinburgh, the king was met by
Sayer de Quinci, Earl of Winchester, and Robert de Ros, who had already
reached the future Scottish capital, and dwelt upon the wrath of their
royal master, and the magnitude of the army with which he was hurrying,
by forced marches, to the north.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Without awaiting the return of the bishop of St. Andrews, William
dispatched a third embassy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span> avert, if possible, the impending
war; and when the bishop reached his royal master at Traquair with
intelligence that the English army was fast approaching the borders,
the reverend envoy was commissioned, for the third time, to return in
the utmost haste to John, and to use every effort to delay his advance
until the Scottish army could be concentrated upon the frontiers.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>By the time John reached Bamborough, towards the close of July, his
formidable preparations for hostilities had fully attained the end upon
which he had probably calculated, by working upon the fears of his
opponent. A brave and warlike army was ranged along either frontier,
prompt and ready for a contest, but advancing years and increasing
infirmities had bowed the once fierce and haughty spirit of the
Scottish king, who was now as averse to risk the chances of war as, in
early manhood, he had been eager in courting its dangers. Under such
circumstances the result could not long remain in doubt, and William,
yielding his consent to the conditions imposed by John, covenanted to
pay 15,000 marks for his “good will” (in other words for peace, and for
the confirmation of his fiefs and privileges, which appear to have been
in danger of forfeiture), and for the performance of certain conditions
specified in their mutual charters. Hostages were to be given by the
Scottish king for the payment of the stated sum within two years.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
Two of his daughters, Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span> and Isabella—the third was probably
under age—were to be delivered into the charge of John, and to be
suitably married according to the tenure of their secret arrangement;
whilst, in return, one of the articles of the treaty provided against
the erection of a castle at Tweedmouth at any future period. The final
settlement of the treaty took place at Northampton, and, within ten
days from its completion, the Scottish princesses were placed in the
hands of the English Justiciary at Carlisle.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span></p>

<p>From the date of this arrangement a close alliance existed between
the kings, and still further to cement their union, <span class="sni">A.
D. 1210.</span> the prince of Scotland proceeded in the following year as
far as Alnwick, where, upon the 10th of May, he performed homage to
John as liegeman for all the fiefs held by his father of the English
crown; and it was probably upon this occasion that the English king,
after receiving the half of the sum of 15,000 marks, in token of amity
remitted the payment of the remainder.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>William, however, in his anxiety to avoid an encounter with John,
appears to have deeply offended many of his own powerful subjects, to
several of whom the English connection had all along been distasteful.
All the advantages of the English fiefs belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span> solely to the
royal family; and as it was of little or no importance to many of
the Scots that the brother of their king should enjoy the earldom of
Huntingdon, or that their sovereign should be received with certain
ceremonies whenever he absented himself from his own dominions to
attend the English Court, they looked with jealousy and discontent
at the concessions extorted from William, through his double anxiety
to prevent hostilities, and to avoid the forfeiture of his English
fiefs and privileges. The treaty concluded at Northampton had been in
direct contradiction to the wishes of the nation, and ere long William
discovered that, in his solicitude to avert the evils of a foreign war,
he had re-kindled the embers of civil discord at home.</p>

<p>The discontent must have been widely disseminated which first
threatened to explode in the south. Thomas de Colvill, a powerful
baron in constant attendance at the court of Scotland, was accused of
conspiring against his liege lord, and detained in Edinburgh Castle
until he was permitted to redeem his treason by the payment of a fine,
and was subsequently dispatched, in a species of honourable captivity,
as a hostage to the king of England.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The storm which had thus
threatened the southern, or feudalized, division of the kingdom was
shortly destined to burst in all its fury upon the distant north and
west, where a Mac William still existed in the person of Godfrey, one
of the sons of Donald Bane. Ireland, as usual, had been his home when
he was not amongst the western isles of Scotland, where he had never
ceased to assert the claims of his family; and either Godfrey, or some
of his partizans, had probably been amongst those “enemies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
king” whom the Earl of Caithness had suffered to escape at Lochloy. No
time could have been more favourable for the revival of his pretensions
than a period of general discontent, and his partizans in Ross, with
all the disaffected clans of the neighbouring provinces, invited him to
cross from Ireland, with promises of their warmest support.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>But in the course of the same autumn, and before the arrival of
Godfrey, the lives of William and his family were threatened by an
unexpected danger from a totally different quarter. The king, with
his brother and the prince of Scotland, was staying with the court at
Perth, when a sudden inundation, occasioned by a spring tide meeting
the swollen waters of the Tay, menaced the town and its inhabitants
with destruction. The old hill-fort at the junction of the Almond with
the Tay was swept away in the deluge, carrying along with it many
houses, and destroying the bridge and an old chapel, whilst the royal
party were at one time in imminent danger, escaping with difficulty the
fury of the flood.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1211</div>

<p>It was winter when Mac William arrived in Ross, and six months elapsed
before an army could be dispatched to operate with effect against
him, the king following by easy marches, as well as his debilitated
condition would allow. Each party pursuing their usual tactics, the
campaign was opened on the royal side by the construction of two
forts, or rather, perhaps, by the repair of the buildings, which had
been raised in the previous war to command the most important points
in the district;<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> whilst Godfrey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span> carefully avoiding a battle,
endeavoured to harass the royal army by continued surprises and night
attacks. Steadily pursuing the course which he had proposed to follow
in his campaign against Donald Bane, the king placed 4000 men under
the command of the Earls of Atholl and Buchan, with Malcolm of Mar and
Thomas the Durward, ordering them to penetrate the recesses of the
mountains in every direction, and force Mac William to an encounter.
Godfrey’s place of strength was upon an island, where he had collected
his treasure and supplies; and here he was at length discovered and
brought to bay by the royal leaders. The struggle was most obstinate,
for the rebels were animated by despair; victory, however, declared for
the royal arms, Godfrey with a few of his companions escaping, though
with difficulty, amongst the clefts and thickets of the neighbouring
mountains.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Satisfied with his success, William returned with the main body of his
army to the south, leaving Earl Malcolm of Fife in charge of Moray.
His departure was the signal for the reappearance of Godfrey, who
suddenly presented himself in force before one of the royal castles,
and commenced preparations for a siege. Alarmed at the prospect of an
attack, and the probable consequences of its success, the garrison
offered to capitulate on condition that their lives were spared; and as
Godfrey willingly agreed to their terms, they were permitted to depart
in safety, and the fort was burnt to the ground.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1212.</div>

<p>The tidings of Godfrey’s proceedings reached William in the winter,
when any hope of taking the field amongst the northern mountains
with the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> probability of success was frustrated by the unusual
severity of the season; and as he had calculated upon his forts
securing the advantages gained in the preceding campaign, he was
incensed and embarrassed at this unexpected loss. A renewal of such
a doubtful contest as the struggle in which he had been engaged with
his cousin, the elder Mac William, was an anxious prospect at his time
of life, and he naturally felt inclined to draw yet closer the ties
connecting him with his English ally.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Ere the winter passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
away the two kings met once more, and for the last time, at Durham;
their conference was adjourned from that place to Norham, where the
queen of Scotland is said to have exerted her influence with both
parties to obtain the treaty of mutual alliance, which was concluded
upon this occasion. <span class="sni">7th Feb.</span> Both kings are said to have
agreed, that, in case of the death of either, the survivor should be
bound to protect and support the youthful heir in securing the rights
of his crown; William conceding to John the privilege of marrying
his son Alexander, now in his fourteenth year, according to his own
pleasure during the next six years, so that the alliance was suitable
to the dignity of the Scottish crown; at the same time confirming his
own, and his son’s, liege homage to the English prince Henry, saving
their fealty to John. The Scottish prince then accompanied the king
of England, upon his return, to the south, and received the honor of
knighthood at St. Brides in Clerkenwell, where John held high festival
in Mid-Lent.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">4th Mar.</div>

<p>With his mind set at rest upon the subject of the English alliance,
William prepared to bend all his remaining energies to the suppression
of the dangerous rebellion in the north. About the middle of June a
considerable force was dispatched to the scene of action, the prince of
Scotland accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> the army to prove himself worthy of his golden
spurs; and the reserve was to have followed by easy marches, under the
immediate orders of the king, when its departure was arrested by the
welcome intelligence of the capture of the head of the rebellion. The
Earl of Fife, during a temporary absence from his command, left the
province under the charge of the Justiciary, William Comyn, Earl of
Buchan, into whose hands the adherents of Mac William, terror-stricken
apparently at the magnitude of the royal preparations, had just
surrendered their leader. The earl had already reached Kincardine
with his prisoner, whom he was in haste to present to William before
death robbed him of his prize—for Godfrey had resolutely refused
all nourishment since his capture—when he was met by a significant
message from the king, that he had no desire to see his enemy; and the
unfortunate Mac William was at once beheaded, and hung up by the feet,
lest starvation should anticipate his doom.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A. D. 1213</div>

<p>The ensuing winter once more found John upon the Scottish frontier.
Whilst on the march in the preceding summer to repress the revolt of
Llewellyn, he had received letters from William, as well as from his
own natural daughter Joanna, the wife of the Welsh prince, warning him
against the intentions of his own barons, if he involved himself in the
intricacies of a mountain warfare in Wales.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> The coincidence of the
arrival of similar warnings from quarters so far apart, aroused his
fears lest the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span> intelligence should be true; and returning in haste to
London, he sent to his principal barons, demanding hostages for their
allegiance and good faith. All obeyed the royal command except Eustace
de Vesci and Robert Fitz Walter; the former, too deeply implicated
apparently to entrust himself within the power of John, at once seeking
refuge with his father-in-law in Scotland. The flight of De Vesci was
amongst the causes which brought John to the north, for it appears that
he had already written to William to claim the fugitive as a traitor.
Norham, as usual, was the place chosen for the conference; but William,
who had been for some time detained at Newbattle by another severe
attack of illness, was unable to proceed farther than Haddington; and
John, who had every reason for desiring, at this period of his reign,
to draw still closer the bonds of union between himself and his fellow
king, earnestly adjured him to depute the young Prince Alexander in
his place, holding out magnificent promises to induce compliance. The
aged king was inclined to send his son, some of his advisers agreeing
with him; but the majority of his council strongly opposed the project,
objecting to entrust the heir of Scotland within the power of John,
of whose intentions they were, not unnaturally, suspicious. They
were fearful, also, lest the English king should detain Alexander as
a hostage for the delivery of De Vesci, and as William eventually
deferred to their opinion, John was obliged to relinquish all hope of a
conference, and return disappointed to the south.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span></p>

<p>During William’s contest with Earl Harald, Olave, the earl’s
brother-in-law, and John Halkelson, sailed from the Orkneys to assist
the son of the Norwegian Regent Erling in placing Sigurd Magnusson upon
his father’s throne. Their fate was most unfortunate; the flower of the
Orkneys assembled around the banner of Olave perishing, with both their
leaders, in the disastrous battle of Floravagr; and their ill-omened
expedition entailing the wrath of the conqueror upon Harald, who only
made his peace with the indignant Sverer by yielding up to Norway the
whole of the Shetland Isles. It was a diminished and impaired dominion,
therefore, which Harald, upon his death in 1206, left as an inheritance
between his three sons; <span class="sni">A. D. 1206.</span> Heinrek succeeding to
his claims upon Ross, whilst David and John divided his possessions
in Caithness and the Orkneys, the latter, upon the death of David,
becoming the sole possessor of both his father’s earldoms.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> To
ensure the submission of Earl John to his authority, William, during
the summer of 1214, proceeded as far as Moray, <span class="sni">A. D. 1214.</span>
when the earl, unwilling to provoke the hostility of his sovereign,
yielded at once to his terms, giving up his daughter and heiress as
a hostage for his fidelity and allegiance. The king then returned by
easy journeys towards the south, but he had far over-taxed his feeble
strength, having risen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span> from a bed of sickness to ensure the tranquil
succession of his son. As he approached the Forth he expressed a wish
to be carried to Stirling, a place for which he appears to have felt
an especial fondness; and here he lingered over the autumn within the
walls of that royal castle, from whence his failing sight could gaze
upon one of the fairest prospects of his native land. He was never
destined to see another year, and on Thursday, the 4th of December,
he breathed his last, expiring in the seventy-third year of his age,
and within five days of entering upon the fiftieth of a chequered and
eventful reign.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>Few materials remain for estimating the personal character of William
beyond the actions ascribed to him in the chronicles of the period.
Newbridge, perhaps a prejudiced authority, contrasts him unfavourably
with his brother Malcolm, regarding many of his misfortunes in the
early part of his career as punishments for his addiction to worldly
pleasures, and attributing the comparative peace and prosperity of his
later years—meaning the period of Richard’s reign—to the beneficial
effects of his marriage with Ermengarde de Bellomont.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> He was a
great man, however, in the opinion of the archdeacon of Brecknock,
Giraldus Cambrensis, and worthy of praise in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span> many things, one blot
only resting upon his glory—throughout the whole length and breadth
of Scotland his will alone decided the disposal of church patronage,
expressly imitating, in this respect, the policy of the English
kings, stigmatized by the archdeacon as “the enormous abuses of the
Norman tyranny in England.”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Giraldus wrote in the spirit of a
churchman of the twelfth century; but it must at least be admitted
that it tells not a little for the energy of William’s character, that
in his contest with the Church of Rome, in the very zenith of her
power, he was successful; neither legate nor pope bending him from
his purpose, though they launched anathemas at his head, and were
supported by Henry, at that time feudal overlord of Scotland. But
though high-spirited and impetuous, even to rashness, in his youth and
manhood, William appears to have been broken down by repeated attacks
of illness as he advanced in life; and the reckless knight-errant,
who rushed upon seven times his numbers at Alnwick, grew into an
over-cautious sovereign, who aroused the discontent of his subjects,
and risked the newly recovered independence of his kingdom, by his
inordinate dread of the consequences of a rupture with England. Some
allowance may be made for his anxiety to carry out the policy of his
grandfather, and re-annex to the Scottish crown the appanage of his
early years, which his brother had resigned at Chester; but from the
comparative ease with which his successor crushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span> every rebellion
within a few years of his accession, firmly established the royal
authority over the whole mainland of Scotland, and vindicated on every
occasion the liberties of his crown and kingdom, it is very evident
that William carried his caution too far; and though circumstances
may have been more favourable to his son, the temporizing policy of
William towards the close of his life must have increased, rather
than diminished, the difficulties of his situation. From the use of
the lion rampant upon his seal, a device which has since become the
well-known cognizance of Scotland, he was very frequently known as
“William the Lion;” and the names of <i>Rufus</i> and <i>Garw</i>—or
the Rough—have also been applied to him, indicating, apparently, some
distinguishing feature in his character, or personal appearance.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
By his marriage with Ermengarde de Bellomont, he left four children; an
only son, Alexander, who succeeded to the throne, and three daughters,
Margaret, Isabella, and Marjory. Margaret, the eldest, was married to
Hubert de Burgh, and left an only daughter, Magota, who died apparently
at an early age. Isabella became the wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of
Norfolk; and Marjory, who appears to have been celebrated for her
beauty, which made a deep impression upon the susceptible heart of
Henry the Third, was subsequently united to Gilbert the Mareschal, Earl
of Pembroke, both the younger princesses dying without issue.</p>

<p>The lengthened reign of William was the era of the more complete
development of David’s changes in church and state; and Scotland, at
the opening of the thirteenth century, was fast progressing towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
the condition of a thoroughly feudalized kingdom in her more settled
portions. Traces of her earlier institutions, however, were still
abundant; the more lenient custom, for instance, of the allodial
system, by which the property of the felon was not confiscated
but descended at once to the heir, was confirmed as the general
law of Scotland, the strict feudal theory being, in other words,
relaxed in favour of “ancient custom;” though where the homicide, or
cattle-lifter, escaped the penalty of the crime by flight, his property
reverted to the lord, the heir only succeeding on the death of the
forfeited proprietor. Even sedition against the king did not disinherit
the heir, if the property was not held directly of the crown; but for
treason against the royal person both life and lands were irretrievably
forfeited. Another concession in favour of “ancient custom,” perhaps,
is traceable in the permission granted to the kindred of a murdered
man to take full legal vengeance on the homicide, even when under
the protection of “the king’s peace,” if they could prove that their
consent had not been obtained to compromise the feud; though, from the
wording of the law in question, this relaxation of the royal power of
pardoning the highest offences, may have been confined to the case of
a murdered witness. In most other respects the usual feudal customs
were generally established; the charter was required as a necessary
document for every freeholder—a stringent enactment being levelled
against all who were convicted of forging such evidence of rights to
which they were not entitled; and the Visnet was fast becoming the
recognised law of the land. Galloway alone formed an exception, in
this point, to the rest of Scotland, retaining her ancient code; no
Galwegian being judged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span> by “the verdict of the neighbourhood,” except
at his especial demand; but very strict rules were laid down for its
substitute, “the wager of battle,”—a fine of <i>ten cows</i> being
enacted for speaking during the progress of a judicial combat; he who
raised his hand, or made a sign, being “at the king’s mercy.” The fines
assessed at Dumfries by “the Judges of Galloway,” appear, indeed, to
have been heavier than in Scotland proper; and the regulations about
collecting the king’s <i>Can</i> in this turbulent province, are marked
with a degree of severity which seems to point to a state of society
in which the royal imposts were still regarded as unwelcome novelties,
all recusants being mulcted in <i>a hundred cows</i>, and bound to
pay one-third more than the original demand. Agriculture was still a
subject of legislation, and the regulations of David, which discouraged
pasturage, were repeated; the barons and greater clergy being exhorted
“to live like lords and masters upon their own domains, not like
husbandmen and shepherds, wasting their lands and the country with
multitudes of sheep and cattle, thereby troubling God’s people with
scarcity, poverty, and utter <i>hership</i>.” Constant travelling with
a retinue unnecessarily large, was also a social feature which it was
still necessary to discountenance; as well as <i>sorning</i>, or living
at free quarters; and unnecessary exaction of <i>herbary</i>, or food
and lodging for the night; the repetition of David’s laws on all these
points displaying the tenacity with which the native baronage clung to
the habits of an earlier age, the sole difference noticeable in the
later enactments of William pointing to one of those changes from a
simpler state of society, which the progress of civilization is sure to
introduce upon “the good old times”—the herbary which, in the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
David, was to be given “for the sake of charity,” in the reign of his
grandson was to be duly recompensed—<i>with pence</i>.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>But though the regulations of David still continued to be the
groundwork of the Scottish constitution, certain modifications were
introduced by William which tended still further to increase the power
of the crown. In the fifteenth year of his reign, “on the Monday before
the festival of St. Margaret” in 1180, in one of these great assemblies
of the whole Frank-tenantry of the kingdom, lay and ecclesiastical,
in which the germs of future parliaments are traceable, and which,
on this occasion, was held at Stirling, it was agreed that, for the
future, none were to hold ordinary courts of justice, or a court of
ordeal, whether “of battle, iron, or water,” except in the presence
of the sheriff, or of one of his serjeants; though, if the official,
after due summons, failed to attend, the court might be held in his
absence. At the same time, the four great pleas, which had been
removed from the jurisdiction of burgh provosts and baron baillies
in the reign of David, were reserved absolutely for the crown.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
Seventeen years later, in 1197, perhaps in consequence of abuses in
the exercise of authority, these minor courts were further regulated
by an ordinance passed in a similar “Parliament” held at Perth, and
attended by “the Bishops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span> Abbots, Earls, Barons, Thanes, and Community
of the Realm;” in which the great barons were pledged to give no
support to law-breakers, whether their own followers or others, and to
take no money for remission of judgment after sentence had been duly
passed; all failing in their duty, in either of these points, being
condemned to forfeit for ever their right to hold a court.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The
regulations of David about the great royal <i>moots</i>, and about
the sheriffs’ courts, were also modified at some period of William’s
reign; and it was ordered that two great assemblies were to be held
yearly at Edinburgh and Peebles, at which every freeholder was bound
to attend, unless prevented by sickness, or other sufficient cause. In
every province the sheriff was to hold a court every forty days—in
this particular following the Norman, or Frank, rather than the Saxon
custom; but bishops, abbots, earls, and probably the greater barons
who enjoyed “the rights and custom of an earl,” were now excused
from personal attendance, appearing by their Seneschals or Stewards,
and only being bound to attend in person upon the court of the royal
justiciary, or of his deputy.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Henceforth the privilege of a
“Regality” was confined to the greater barons or clergy, upon whom it
was conferred by royal favour; a sure sign of the progress of order,
and of the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> authority. It may be remarked that a Regality in
the feudal period was generally on some frontier; or was a district
made over to some powerful noble to control, as he best might, by the
strong hand; and in England, the sole provinces of this description
were the <i>Palatinates</i> of Chester and Durham, the former on
the Welsh frontier, the latter upon the borders of that turbulent
Northumbrian province which, at one period, could be scarcely reckoned
as an integral, or settled, portion of either England or Scotland.
David probably interfered but little with the privileges of the ancient
earls within their immediate possessions, limiting his innovations
upon their earlier duties and prerogatives to the introduction of the
royal <i>Vicecomes</i>: but William was enabled to advance a step
further; the royal authority was becoming firmer, and was now made
paramount throughout the settled portion of Scotland, except where the
greater barons or higher clergy were specially privileged; though the
right to execute within the precincts of his own barony the homicide
taken “red-hand,” or the robber captured with the stolen cattle, still
remained the privilege of every baron who claimed the jurisdiction of
“pit and gallows.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of his usual line of policy, William also carried out the
ecclesiastical and commercial measures of his predecessors, ordering
the general payment of tithes and dues throughout the kingdom, defining
the means by which his edicts were to be put in force, and assimilating
the dioceses of Aberdeen and Moray to the model bishoprics of Glasgow
and St. Andrews.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> More than this he appears to have been unable to
effect, for the church lands in the sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span> of Brechin and Dunblane were
still in the possession of great lay feudatories, disinclined as yet to
restore the property to the bishops, and too powerful to be rendered
discontented by any overprompt measures of alienation. Even in Dunkeld
the chapter was not as yet provided for; Ross was in a chronic state
of rebellion during the greater part of this reign; and Caithness was
at this time hardly more than a nominal province of Scotland. Only one
religious foundation is ascribed to William, the monastery of Arbroath,
which he dedicated to the memory of Thomas à Becket, with whom he
is sometimes said to have been on terms of familiar intimacy at the
English court in his earlier years; and from the date of this tribute
to the memory of the martyred archbishop, which was completed and
endowed within a very few years after the king’s return from captivity,
it would certainly appear as if William had been very much impressed at
the time by the peculiar circumstances of his capture.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Though David may be regarded unquestionably as the founder of the
Scottish burghs, many were indebted to William for the earliest
charters confirmatory of their original privileges. Monopoly was,
as usual, ensured to the privileged class within the walls, no one
being allowed to sell the produce of his lands or flocks except
to burgesses;<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> commerce, thus forbidden to the nobility, was
confined to the burgher class; and the result was the same all over
Europe. There is not a trace amongst the Teutonic people, in early
times, of that broad line of distinction which grew up in a later age
between the soldier and the merchant, the man of arms and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span> the man of
commerce—though the few actual trades, or rather handicrafts, of the
period, were probably confined to the unfree. “Biorn the merchant”
was the son of a king, and the spirit of commerce was strongly
developed amongst the early Northmen. But the burghers claimed it as
their exclusive privilege, and their monopolies were fostered and
encouraged, stringent laws prohibiting the <i>upland</i> nobility
from entering into competition with the freemen within the walls; and
accordingly they soon grew to despise pursuits in which they were
thus precluded from engaging. No such restrictions existed in Italy,
and her merchants were amongst the noblest in the land. Elsewhere the
exclusive monopolies of a <i>Roturier</i> class very much contributed
to stamp commerce, in the Middle Ages, as a pursuit generally confined
to the low-born. David’s commercial, like his religious, foundations
were principally to the southward of the Forth—his views were directed
towards Northumberland—and though many of his burghs were planted
to the northward of that river, and particularly in the forfeited
province of Moray, it is from the confirmatory charters of William
that their existence is first discovered. Not a few additions were
also made by William to the number of Scottish burghs—foremost in
importance to future ages the bishop’s burgh of Glasgow—and Galloway,
Scottish Cumbria, and the northern and eastern coasts of Scotland
proper, were studded with commercial garrisons. Berwick still appears
to have monopolized the foreign trade, and its importance may be best
appreciated by the clause inserted in one of the treaties between John
and William, engaging the English king to stop the further progress
of the castle at Tweedmouth, which had evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span> been intended
to aim a fatal blow at the most flourishing emporium of Scottish
commerce.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> But it was upon the northern and eastern coasts of
<i>Scotia</i> proper, and upon that portion of the northern coast
which had been reclaimed from <i>Moravia</i> by the establishment
of Inverness, that the progress and advancement of the kingdom were
most marked in William’s reign. David’s favourite residences appear
to have been generally in the south and centre of his kingdom, but
William was often in the north, and many of his charters are dated
from Forfar and Aberdeen, and from the Moray burghs of Nairn, Forres,
Elgin, and Inverness. The latter burgh was a thorough garrison, and
in return for certain privileges which its inhabitants enjoyed over
other burgesses, they were bound to keep in good repair the ditch and
rampart, which the king had thrown up around the town. Most of the
great families which are still to be found in this quarter—Chisholms,
Roses, Bissetts now represented by the Frasers, and others—are of
Scoto-Norman origin, descendants of the auxiliaries planted in, by the
Scottish kings, “in the times of eld,” to defend the lands they had won
from the supporters of Mac Heth, or Mac William; their names, though
they have long been enrolled most worthily in the ranks of “Scottish
Highlanders,” yet recalling the time in which the ancient house of
Moray was finally crushed by the power of the rival house of Atholl;
and when the hereditary earldom of Macbeth was the real <i>march</i>
of royal Scotland towards the north, held by the disciplined valour
of the Normans. Inverness was the key of the lowlands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span> of Moray, and
in many respects an outpost of civilization, from which, in the next
reign, the royal power extended still further over the north and west.
The views of David were turned southwards, and he never ceased to hope
that the ancient territories of the Northumbrian Ealdormen might yet
be numbered amongst the appanages of the Scottish crown. But William,
in his later years, if the Scottish version of his secret treaty with
John is correct, was ready to waive his claims upon Northumberland; and
as the unsubstantial vision of the fair English earldom faded from his
sight, he may have directed his attention more exclusively to his own
kingdom, and have inaugurated that wiser line of policy which, in the
course of his son’s reign, united the whole of the Scottish mainland in
loyal obedience to the king.</p>

the age which attributed every Roman relic in Scotland to the time
of Agricola. The work abounds in internal evidence of its falsity.
Vespasiana is said to have received the name in honour of the Flavian

(l. 2, c. 6, s. 50), and with <i>Mæata</i> to have been lost under
Trebellius, the successor of Lucullus, who had been put to death by
Domitian (l. 2, c. 2, s. 16): but of these two provinces, which must
have been created by his own father-in-law, Tacitus, writing during the
reign of Trajan, displays a profound ignorance. Valentia again, the
creation of Theodosius, about 369, is said to have been made a consular
province by Constantine, who died two and thirty years before! (l. 1,
c. 6, s. 3.) Such are a few specimens of the stupid blunders of its

mean the “Debateable Land” between Picts, Scots, Angles, and Britons

tres electiones factæ quando non fuit nisi unus solus episcopus in

vested in Iona, passed subsequently to Dunkeld and St. Andrews,
neither of which were in existence before the early part of the ninth
century, it may be inferred that, during the intervening period, it
remained with Abernethy. It was usually vested in the <i>Cowarb</i>, or

of his countrymen had perished, it was maintained that he had written
a history and then destroyed it (<i>Gild. Capit.</i> 20); and Walter
Mapes, bringing a book (as he said) from Brittany, where no other copy
has ever been found, gave it to Geoffrey of Monmouth to translate. The
work is called in Welsh the <i>Brut Tyssilio</i>, and is attributed to
a certain Tyssilio living in the seventh century, who writes familiarly
of <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Moray</i>, and <i>Normandy</i>, and brings the
“Twelve Peers of France” to Arthur’s Coronation! Granting the existence
of these Twelve Peers, how could Tyssilio, living in the seventh
century, have been familiar with the institution of Charlemagne, who
died in the ninth? In the nineteenth century the <i>Brut</i> has
been “done into English” with some very marvellous notes, in which
the curious inquirer will find Cæsar refuted by Tyssilio, and Homer
corrected by Dares Phrygius!</p>

of Kenneth’s grandfather with a sister of Constantine and Angus rests
solely on tradition, but it appears the most probable solution of his
peaceful accession to the throne. The examples of Talorcan, son of
<i>Eanfred</i>, perhaps also of his cousin Bruidi son of <i>Bili</i>,
which is a British name, shews that the alien extraction of the father
was no bar to the succession of the son. Such a succession would be
exactly in accordance with the old custom mentioned by Beda, that
“in cases of difficulty” the female line was preferred to the male;
<i>i.e.</i>, a near connection in the female line to a distant male
heir. From not attending to the expression “in cases of difficulty,”
the sense of Beda’s words has been often misinterpreted.</p>

Badwulf is alluded to by <i>Sim. Dun.</i> under 796. The topography
of Galloway and the language once spoken by the Galwegians
(who acknowledged a <i>Kenkinny</i>—<i>Cen-cinnidh</i>—not a
<i>Pen-cenedl</i>) distinguish them from the British race of Strath
Clyde—the <i>Walenses</i> of the early charters as opposed to the
<i>Galwalenses</i>. Beda, however, knew of no Picts in the diocese of
Candida Casa (<i>v. Appendix K</i>), and consequently they must have
arrived at some later period, though it would be difficult to point
with certainty to their original home. Some authorities bring them
from Dalaraide, making them <i>Cruithne</i> or Irish Picts; and the
dedication of numerous churches in Galloway to saints popular in the
north-east of <i>Uladh</i> seems to favour their conjecture. The name
of Galloway is probably traceable to its occupation by <i>Gall</i>, in

This is the earliest historical appearance of the <i>Vikings</i> on the
Scottish coasts. The name has no connection with <i>king</i>, being
derived from <i>Vik</i> a bay, <i>Viking</i> a baysman. By northern
law, every freeman was bound to be enrolled in a <i>Hafn</i>, and to
contribute towards building and manning a ship for the royal service,
the office of <i>Styresman</i> being always hereditary in the family
of an <i>Odal-Bonder</i>. Thus, the royal ship, authorized to kill,
burn, and destroy in lawful warfare, sailed from the <i>Hafn</i>,
whilst the rover on his own account, stigmatized in “degenerate days”
as a pirate, put off from the <i>Vik</i> or open bay. He was as little
likely to sail from a royal <i>Hafn</i>, as a Highland chieftain bent
upon a <i>creagh</i> to issue from the royal castle of Inverness. Hence
perhaps the name.</p>

called themselves by names which have now become <i>Deutsch</i> and

to the situation of Atholl, immediately to the southward of the
Grampian range. Northwards of Atholl the country is still known as

inapplicable to its present state, answering probably to <i>Fidach</i>.
<i>Fodh</i>, a word evidently derived from the same source as the

the foot of <i>Fodhla</i> (<i>Fodh-lad</i>), or <i>Fo’la</i>, which
seems to have answered amongst the Gael very much to <i>Gwlad</i>.

the Earl of Argyle was fostered by Campbell of Glenurchy, ancestor
of the Breadalbane family. “In the Lowlands,” says Mr. Innes, “the
practice was evidently common under the civil law.” In fact, fosterage
was not peculiar to the Highlanders and Celtic people in particular,
though, like many other old customs, it remained in force amongst
them long after it had disappeared elsewhere. By Ini’s Law (63), the
<i>fosterer</i> was one of the three dependants whom the Gesithcundman
might take with him under any circumstances. The system was admirably
adapted for implanting the members of a dominant amongst a subordinate
race, who, in the course of a few generations, must have thus become
united in the ties of interest and affection with the ruling “caste.”
No such ties bound the <i>villein</i> to his feudal lord; and the evils
and advantages arising out of each system were totally different.
It was this custom which above all others tended to render the
Anglo-Norman lords “beyond the pale,” <i>Hibernis Hiberniores</i>. As
much devotion was shewn to a <i>Geraldine</i> as to a <i>MacArthy</i>.</p>

the <i>Vergobreith</i>, not the <i>Toshach</i>, who was “consecrated”
by the Druids, <i>v.</i> p. 28, n.†. Giraldus Cambrenses has left an extraordinary
description of the barbarous rites with which the inauguration of the
princes of Cinel Conal was celebrated. He wrote from hearsay, and very
probably heightened the colouring of a picture that was exaggerated in
the first instance; for he fully participated in that rooted antipathy
which seems to have long existed between the Welsh and the Irish. Still
the words of Ailred shew that certain barbarous ceremonies on such
occasions lingered amongst the Scottish Gael in the twelfth century,
shocking the more fastidious ideas of David after he had “rubbed off
his Scottish rust.” “Unde et obsequia illa quæ a gente Scottorum in
novella regum promotione more patrio, exhibentur ita exhorruit ut ea
vix ab episcopis suscipere cogeretur” (<i>Twysden</i>, p. 348). The
conspicuous part still assigned at coronations to the Scottish “Stone
of Destiny” is as well known as are the numerous tales and fables
connected with it. In his “Essay on Tara” Mr. Petrie impugns the
identity of the stone in St. Edward’s chair with the genuine <i>Lia
Fail</i>, upon which the Ardrighs of Ireland were inaugurated at Tara;
where, in his opinion, the mystic stone of the “Tuath de Danan” still
remains in spite of the claims of the Dalriads and the fables of the
Connaughtmen. It indeed seems extraordinary that a small and migratory
tribe from the north of Antrim should have been permitted to carry off
with them the “sacred stone” of the Irish kings, and I am inclined to
look upon the Scottish <i>Lia Fail</i> as the stone upon which the
<i>Pictish</i> kings and their successors were consecrated, its only
migration, unless it was removed from <i>Dunfothir</i> to <i>Scone</i>,
having been undertaken at the order of Edward the First; though after
the Gaelic people of Scotland had identified their own ancestry with
that of the MacAlpin line of princes the <i>Lia Fail</i> necessarily
became mixed up with the supposed wanderings of the latter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> The early Frank kings used to migrate in this way from
<i>manor</i> to <i>manor</i>, and the custom long prevailed amongst
the Scandinavians. It was the origin of the “<i>sorning</i>,” a word
derived from the same source as the French <i>sejourner</i>, and
“<i>Waldgastnung</i>,” so often prohibited in the old laws of Scotland
and the north. The Anglo-Saxons were perfectly well acquainted with
the same custom, and lands were held for a certain number of “night’s
<i>feorm</i>”—so many nights’ free quarters <i>originally</i>,—the
name of the tenure being at length permanently transferred to the
<i>tenant</i> and <i>tenement</i>. Hence our words <i>Farmer</i> and
<i>Farm</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> Most of the materials for this sketch have been taken
from “Martin’s Western Isles,” the “Irish Annals,” and the “Works of
the Irish Archæological Society,” particularly the “Hy Fiachrach,”
where the subject is ably illustrated by Mr. O’Donovan in <i>Appendix
L</i>. The “Circuit of Murketagh” contains an interesting account
of the manner in which hostages and tribute were exacted, and the
different methods of proceeding with kinsmen, allies, and rivals. The
theory of <i>Tanistry</i> extended to ecclesiastical offices, and we
meet with <i>Tanist</i> bishops and <i>Adbhar</i> abbots; the former
signifying, apparently, the successor <i>actually</i> chosen, the
latter one <i>eligible</i> to be chosen. Thus, and in many other ways,
the old Celtic principle of division appears to have gradually pervaded
their branch of the church. Even the careful separation of sacerdotal
<i>authority</i> from practical <i>power</i> seems to have clung to the
Gaelic people for some time after their conversion; for while the Hy
Nial for centuries monopolized the supreme power, the <i>Primacy</i>
was the exclusive appanage of the Clan Colla, <i>a race excluded from

Angus (<i>Tigh.</i> 739), and from the foundation of Dunkeld and St.

the provinces connected with those monasteries were “in the crown.” In
the Irish annals <i>Fortreim</i> is latterly almost synonymous with the
kingdom of the Picts. Its capital, <i>Dun-Fothir</i>, was evidently
the Scottish <i>Tara</i>, and <i>Dundurn</i> in the north perhaps the
Scottish <i>Cashel</i>. Moray and Mærne seem to have long been the
leading subdivisions of the north, but it would be difficult to name
the corresponding divisions of the south. Abernethy appears to have
been connected with Strathearn, Dunkeld with Atholl, and St. Andrews
with Fife.</p>

distinguished from their rivals the <i>Oirir-Gael</i>, or Gael of the
coasts (<i>i.e.</i>, of <i>Argyle</i>). Mr. Skene (<i>Highlanders</i>,
pt. 2, c. 2) considers them to have been identical, on the strength
of a passage which, I think, scarcely bears him out. When the fleet
of Turlough O’Connor ravaged Tir Conal and Inch Eogan in 1154 (A. F.
M.), the clan Eogan sent to hire “Longus Gallgaidhel, Arann, Cinntire,
Manann et Cantair Alban” ships of the Gallgael, Arran, Kintyre, Man,
and “the coasts of Alban,” <i>i.e.</i> Oirir-Gael. Gallgael must here
mean the Islesmen. The Orkneyinga Saga (<i>Antiq. Celt.-Scan.</i>, p.
180) calls the Caithness men Gaddgedlar or Gallgael; in short, it was
the name of the two races when blended, and in later days there was
a continual struggle for superiority between the Oirir-Gael and the
Gallgael—represented by the families of Somarled and of the later
kings of Man,—in which the former were ultimately successful, uniting
at length under one head the dominion of Argyle and the Isles. There
is a slight discrepancy in the accounts of Ketil contained in the
Sagas. He was leader of the Gallgael when Harfager was an infant, and
appears to have succeeded Godfrey MacFergus, whose name betokens a
mixed descent, and who died in 853 (<i>A. F. M.</i>, 851). The Gallgael
possessed the islands before the time of Harfager.</p>

the Picts and Dugall in 875, when the former were defeated with great
slaughter (<i>An. Ult.</i>), the battles of Dollar and Coach-Cochlum,
two years before the death of Constantine, <i>i.e.</i>, in the same
year; and finally the death of Oistin or Thorstein MacOlave, placed by
the Ulster annals under the same date, all mark the year 875 to have
been the era of his brief triumph. All accounts agree that Thorstein
perished by unfair means. “He was betrayed by the Scots and slain in
battle.”—<i>Landnamaboc.</i> “The Scots did not keep the treaty long,
but betrayed him in confidence”—<i>Laxdæla Saga.</i> These authorities
are confirmed by the Ulster annals, which record the death of Thorstein

cruel death of “the spread eagle.” The period of this reign is easily
ascertained. Under the first year the Chronicle No. 3 places the death
of Malsechnal, king of Ireland; and as that king died on Tuesday 20th
November (<i>A.F.M.</i>), his death must have occurred in 863. The same
chronicle records the death of Aodh MacNial, king of Ireland, which
happened in 879, under the second year of Eocha and Cyric (Grig), thus
placing their accession, and consequently the death of Constantine’s
brother Aodh, in 878. As the reign of Aodh lasted for only a year, that
of his brother must have begun in 863 and ended in 877.</p>

twenty-two years, from 878 to 900, the dates in the Ulster annals of
the deaths of Aodh and Donald; and as Eocha reigned for eleven years
(<i>Chron.</i> 5), Donald must have succeeded in 889. The Chron. No.
3 places an eclipse on St. Ciric’s Day (16th June) under the ninth
year of Eocha and Cyric. This actually occurred on 16th June 885, in
the <i>eighth</i> year of their reign; and allowing for the trifling
inaccuracy of a year, it is evidently the eclipse referred to. From
confounding St. Ciric with St. Siriac, on whose day (8th August 891) an
eclipse also happened, both Pinkerton and Chalmers have misdated all
these reigns.</p>

of Norham, when the obedience of Guthred, son of Hardicanute (rather
a mythical personage), to the dictates of Abbot Edred’s vision, in
restoring the lands of St. Cuthbert between Tyne and Wear to the
Church, was rewarded by the intervention of the Saint in behalf of
the sacred territory, when it was invaded by a band of Scots, who
were miraculously engulphed in the yawning earth! <i>Sim. Dun. Hist.
Dun.</i>, l. 2, c. 14. <i>Leland</i>, vol. i. p. 329. It is a pity
the miracle was not repeated a few years later, when Reginald Hy Ivar
divided these very lands amongst his pagan followers. What with the
<i>sac</i>, <i>soc</i> and <i>infangthief</i>, granted by Guthred in
the ninth century, the fine of 96 Anglo-Norman pounds, and the near
vicinity of the Scots to St. Cuthbert’s territory, the story affords a
very fair specimen of the inventions by which the monks occasionally
tried to give a title to lands which they often really possessed
rightfully, though without legal proof of such right. A miracle or a
victory, especially if either were at the expense of the Scots, lent an
air of sanctity or authority to the fabrication, which it would have
been impious or unpatriotic to doubt.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> <i>An. Ult.</i> 901–903. The Egill’s Saga (<i>Antiq.
Celt.-Scand.</i> p. 32), in describing Olave the Red, calls him “the
son of a native Scot, by a descendant of Ragnar Lodbroc,” meaning
by the expression “a native Scot,” that his father was of Scottish
descent by both parents. This description cannot apply to Olave’s
father Sitric and his brothers, the well-known grandsons of Ivar, whose
children could not possibly have been of pure Scottish descent. It is
remarkable, however, that the name of the <i>father</i> of Sitric and
his brothers is never mentioned by the Irish annalists, who invariably
call them Hy Ivar, or <i>grandsons</i> of Ivar (for the <i>Hy</i> had
not yet become a family prefix), whilst they also frequently allude
to Godfrey and Sitric, the sons of Ivar, and their descendants, who
never attained to the same celebrity as the others. These latter
more famous Hy Ivar appear to have been in some way connected with
the Western Isles, where their descendants were long regarded in the
light of a royal race. The first appearance of Reginald Hy Ivar is in
a naval battle off the Isle of Man; and as his family had no footing
at that time either in England, Scotland, or Ireland, he must have
recruited his fleet from amongst the Gall-Gael. Nearly thirty years
later the son of Reginald was driven from the same Western Islands,
which he probably had inherited in his childhood (for Reginald and his
brothers were young), when the English and Irish possessions of his
father fell to the share of his uncles Sitric and Godfrey. (<i>An.
Ult.</i> 942. <i>An. F. M.</i> 940.) After the death of Godfrey Mac
Fergus in 853, who figures in the genealogy of Somarled, lord of the
<i>Oirir-Gael</i>, and must have been (from his name) of Scottish
descent by the father’s side, the Isles next appear under the rule
of Caittil or Ketil, a Norwegian, but as his sons settled in Iceland
after the expedition of Harfager (Landnamabok), he could not have
transmitted his power to his descendants; and the Sagas say that the
Isles then fell into the hands of Scottish and Irish Vikings. If one
of these Vikings, a Scottish lord of the Gall-Gael or Oirir-Gael, had
married Ivar’s daughter, the description in the Egill’s Saga would
exactly apply to himself, his wife, and his sons, and it would be only
necessary to suppose that the writer of the Saga, aware of Olave’s
descent from a Scottish Viking and a grand-daughter of Ragnar Lodbroc,
made him by mistake the <i>son</i> instead of the <i>grandson</i> of
the Scot. This supposition would equally account for the connection of
the Hy Ivar with the Isles, and the ignorance of the Irish annalists
respecting their father’s name.</p>

record that Sitric, the <i>son</i> of Ivar, killed, or was killed
by, his brother. In 919 the same authorities mention that Sitric,
the <i>grandson</i> of Ivar, slew Nial, King of Ireland, in battle.
Some of the Anglo-Norman chroniclers, and one late MS. of the Saxon
Chronicle, evidently confounding these events, make the younger Sitric
the murderer of his brother Nial.</p>

According to the Irish annalists, Sitric died <i>immaturâ aetate</i>,
and consequently his son Olave must have been too young to offer any
opposition to Athelstan. The MS. <i>C. T.</i>, B. iv., which alludes to
Sitric and Godfrey, is, like the Ulster annals, a year behind the true
date at this period. As Godfrey was present at a battle in Ireland,
fought on 28th December 926, and left Dublin in the following year,
upon hearing of the death of his brother, returning thither after an
absence of six months, the transactions to which Malmesbury and the
Chronicle allude must have taken place during this interval.</p>

<i>Malm. Gesta Regum</i>, l. 2, s. 133. The Saxon Chronicle (MS. <i>C.
T.</i>, B. iv., of the eleventh century) states that the kings met at
Emmet, in Yorkshire, and renounced idolatry, a singular compact for
a prince who, twenty years before, had presided at an ecclesiastical
council at Scone! Malmesbury, who takes his account from an old
volume containing a metrical history of Athelstan, “in quo scriptor
cum difficultate materiæ luctabatur (et) ultra opinionem in laudibus
principis vagatur,” places the meeting at Dacor in Cumberland, adding
that Athelstan commanded the son of Constantine to be baptised! Here
again the Scottish King figures as a pagan, as he also does in the
same writer’s description of the battle of Brunanburgh, where he says
that the survivors of the vanquished host were spared to embrace
Christianity. There is an evident confusion here between the pagan
Northmen, to whom all this is very applicable, and the Christian
Scots. It is highly probable both that Sitric “renounced idolatry” on
the occasion of his marriage with Athelstan’s sister, and that his
son Olave, who ended his life in the monastery of Iona, was baptised
through the intervention of the English king, but the same cannot
be said of the Christian King of Scotland. From time immemorial, as
we learn from Malcolm Ceanmor (<i>Sim. Dun.</i> 1093), it was the
custom of the English and Scottish kings to meet upon their respective
frontiers; but though the borders of Yorkshire and Cumberland were
the most appropriate places of meeting for Sitric and his English
brother-in-law, they were on the Danish, not the Scottish frontier;
and what should bring Constantine thither to renounce idolatry in his
declining years, and baptise his son at the bidding of the English
king? Much of the history of this period appears to have been derived
from old songs and lays, in which due allowance must be made for the
confusion and mistakes incidental to such legendary compositions,
as well as for the “genus dicendi quod suffultum Tullius appellat,”
especially in the struggles of the transcriber to Latinise the
barbarous idioms of the vernacular, alluded to with such contemptuous
pity by Malmesbury. The vague and exaggerated expressions of these
old ballads were frequently copied literally, and latterly in the
feudal idiom, into the dry chronicle of a subsequent era, a fate which
has frequently befallen the sole Saxon record of the famous battle
of Brunanburgh. In the scanty records of this, the most glorious and
least known period of Anglo-Saxon history, it is very evident that
Constantine has frequently usurped the place of Sitric,—just as in
the Egill’s Saga Olave Sitricson figures as King of Scotland, to the
total exclusion of his own father-in-law,—but it would be difficult
to do more than point out the confusion. The Anglo-Norman writers, of
course, take advantage of the confused and indistinct idea of a treaty
between Athelstane and Constantine to turn it to their own account,
but they have been far outdone by a modern historian, who has actually
described the manner in which the Scottish king performed fealty to
Athelstan—<i>More Francico</i>, in set form, as laid down in the Liber
de Beneficiis—though it would be impossible to say from what source
he has obtained his vivid description of the feudal ceremony, for it
certainly is not contained in any of the authorities to which he refers
(<i>Malm.</i>, 27, 28. <i>Flor.</i>, 602. <i>Mail.</i>, 147), nor was
the Frankish ceremony of homage in force amongst the Anglo-Saxons of
that era.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> Olave was Constantine’s son-in-law at the time of the
battle of Brunanburgh, but as Sitric died at an early age, and Olave
survived his father for nearly sixty years, it is improbable that
the connection could have existed till some years after Sitric’s
death, when it will explain why Constantine, who at that time was not
at variance with Athelstan, and who had supported the Northumbrian
Saxons against their mutual enemies the Hy Ivar, became an object of
suspicion to the English king when it appeared to be his aim to favour
the establishment of his son-in-law in the Danish province, as he had
already secured his brother upon the throne of Strath Clyde.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> <i>Chron. Sax.</i> <i>Sim. Dun. ad an.</i> “Athelstan
went into Scotland as well with a land army as with a fleet, and
there <i>over-harried</i> much.” Such are the expressions of the
<i>Chronicle</i>, the earliest and best authority respecting an
expedition which has grown in the pages of the Anglo-Norman annalists
into the complete conquest of Scotland. Simeon gives three versions:
in his first, from original sources, merely mentioning the extent of
the incursion to Dunfœder (or Forteviot) and Wertermore. In his second,
copying Florence, he makes Constantine purchase peace at the price
of his son’s captivity; and in his third, in return for the gifts of
Athelstan to the shrine of St. Cuthbert—and on such occasions the
chronicler is never behind-hand in liberality—Scotland is thoroughly
subdued (<i>Twysden</i>, pp. 134, 154, 25). It is a very appropriate
occasion for the exhibition of the <i>suffultum genus scribendi</i> by
the Anglo Norman writers; and the opportunity has not been passed over.
According to Brompton (<i>Twysden</i>, p. 838), Athelstan demanded a
sign from St. John of Beverley, “quo præsentes et futuri cognoscere
possent Scotos de jure debere Anglis subjugari.” It was granted, and
the king’s sword clove an ell of rock from the foundations of Dunbar
Castle! “Possessiones, privilegia, et libertates,” rewarded the
miracle, a price for which there was scarcely a patron saint in the
country who would not have been made to confirm with signs and wonders
the rightful supremacy of the English king over any people he chose to
name. The monks of Newburgh outdid even Brompton, detaining Athelstan
for three years in Scotland, whilst he placed “princes” over her
provinces, provosts over her cities, and settled the amount of tribute
to be paid from the most distant islands! (<i>Doc. etc. Illus. Hist.
Scot.</i>, No. 33.) The tale reappears, as might be expected, in the
time of the first Edward, in its most exaggerated form, as “Inventa in
quodum libro de vita et miraculis beati Johannis de Beverlaco <i>quæ
sunt per Romanam curiam approbata</i> (<i>Fœd.</i>, vol. i., p. 771).
Dr. Lingard, through one of those oversights which occasionally serve
to strengthen his arguments in Scottish matters, has transferred to
this expedition the epithets applied by Æthelward to the battle of
Brunanburgh.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> At this time there were two prominent characters
amongst the descendants of Ivar of the name of Anlaf or Olave, who
have frequently been confounded. Olave, the son of Sitric, known in
the Sagas under the name of Olave the Red—the <i>an t sainnr</i>
of the <i>A. F. M.</i> 978—sometimes as Olave Cuaran (for his son
Sitric, who fought at Clontarf is called Olave Quaran’s son in the
Niala Saga, <i>Antiq. Celt.-Scand.</i>, p. 108), became the head
of his family upon the death of his uncle Godfrey, and to him the
Sagas invariably attribute the supreme rule over the Norsemen at
Brunanburgh and elsewhere. Upon the death of Athelstan, the whole of
England north of Watling Street was ceded to “Olave of Ireland,” and
for four years Olave Sitricson retained his hold upon the conquered
districts, until the successes of Edmund drove him across the channel
to Ireland. He frequently appears in English history subsequently as
the opponent of Eric of the Bloody Axe and the Anglo-Saxon monarchs;
but his name does not occur in the Irish annals before he was driven
from Northumbria in 944; and about eight years later, relinquishing all
hopes of obtaining his father’s English kingdom, he established himself
permanently in Dublin, ruling the Irish Norsemen for nearly thirty
years, and bequeathing his dominion to his descendants. Olave, the son
of Godfrey, succeeded his father in Dublin in 934, crossed the sea in
the autumn of 937, and joining in the battle of Brunanburgh, reappeared
in Ireland in the following year. He again appeared in England when
Olave of Ireland was chosen by the Northumbrian Danes for their king,
and shared the supremacy with his kinsman until his death at Tyningham
in 941. Guthferd or Godfrey, the son of Hardacanute, a personage whose
existence is somewhat doubtful, but who is supposed to have succeeded
Halfdan, is often confounded with either Godfrey <i>mac</i> Ivar or
Godfrey <i>hy</i> Ivar. The Irish annals, sagas, and Simeon, are my
authorities for this sketch.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> <i>Heimskringla, Saga</i> 4, c. 3. The tie of blood
was the great bond of union in these days, and a member of a “royal
race” could unite the most discordant elements under his standard. The
invaders of the British Isles, like their greatest leaders Olave and
Ivar—the one an Ingling, the other a Skioldung—were of Norwegian and
Danish race, but after the death of Thorstein, Olave’s son, without
known issue, as no prominent scion of the race of Halfdan Hvitbein
remained, Dane and Norwegian both looked for their leaders to the
family of Ragnar Lodbroc, the Hy Ivar. Eric, however, was of the blood
of Halfdan Hvitbein, and by placing him amongst the Northmen, Athelstan
skilfully sowed the seeds of discord, which yielded an abundant harvest
a few years later in the contests between him and Olave Sitricson.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> It is doubtful which Olave is meant. When Edmund regained
Northumbria, Olave Sitricson and Reginald Godfreyson appear to have
been joint kings, so that it is probable that the two Olaves divided
the supremacy in return for the assistance of the son of Godfrey
in reinstating his kinsman. The death of Athelstan is assigned to
the years 939 and 941. Ethelward places his death two years after
Brunanburgh, in 939, and the charter 411 (<i>Cod. Dip. Ang. Sax.</i>,
vol. ii.) would favour this date. There are many charters of Edmund in
940, none of Athelstan after 939.</p>

whose successors Guthfert and Reginald are evidently Godfrey Haraldson
and his son Reginald, kings of Man after Maccus or Magnus Haraldson,
who killed Eric in 954, at which time he probably acquired the kingdom
of Man and the Isles. The Irish annals mention that in 942 the son of
Reginald Hy Ivar was driven from the Isles by “Gall from beyond sea;”
and it seems highly probable that these were the followers of Eric, who
must have established himself in the dominion of the islands about this
time.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> The period of this reign has been chosen by the
Anglo-Norman writers as the era in which a feudal supremacy, in a
strict Anglo-Norman sense, was first acquired over Scotland by her
southern neighbour; and the theory, as might be expected, is supported
in an appropriate manner. Three years after the death of Reginald, the
fiery Dane is resuscitated from his grave, and placed, by the fiat of
the English chroniclers, side by side with Constantine and the Prince
of Strath Clyde, brought, together with the whole free population of
Cumbria, Scotland, and Danish Northumbria, from the borders of the
Forth, the Clyde, and the Humber, to the distant Peak of Derbyshire, to
tender homage to the Saxon Edward at Bakewell! Yet their submission,
and even the unwonted journey so far from their respective frontiers,
fail to avert their sorrowful fate; for though Reginald is permitted to
return to his tomb, his luckless companions are wantonly hurled from
their thrones upon the accession of Athelstan; whilst, to enhance the
glory of the Saxon king, Aldred of Bamborough is made the companion
of their flight. He was the faithful friend of Edward, the son of
Eadulf, “the darling” of the great Alfred,—considerations which have
little weight with the ruthless chroniclers; and Aldred is raised to
an evanescent independence, to swell the triumph of Athelstan by being
ejected from what is called “his kingdom!” As history advances, fresh
links are added to the chain of bondage, and the decreasing power of
the Anglo-Saxon monarchs marches hand in hand with the increasing
submission of the Scottish kings. Then is exhibited the singular
anomaly of an obedient and obsequious vassal appropriating without
ceremony the territories of his sovereign lord, until the climax
is attained in the reign of the Confessor; and at a time when the
over-powerful subjects of that prince seem to have been fast verging
towards independence, freely and willingly does the Scottish king
tender that allegiance for his entire kingdom which the iron-willed
successors of the feeble Edward in vain attempted to extort. Into such
errors and inconsistencies have the great majority of Anglo-Norman
chroniclers fallen in endeavouring to found a claim to a feudal
supremacy over Scotland in an age in which neither amongst Scots nor
Anglo-Saxons was the feudal system in force.—<i>V. Appendix L</i>, pt.

Dunmail—hardly the same person as Donald MacEogan, who died in

story is probably about as true as the account of the same chronicler
that the English king was assisted on this occasion by Llewellyn of
South Wales. In 945 Howell Dha was king of South Wales, and as none
of his sons bore the name of Llewellyn, the only person whom the
Welsh writers can find to participate in the expedition is Llewellyn
ap Sitsylt—who died 76 years later, in 1021—the father of Harold’s
opponent, Griffith, and of Blethyn and Rhywallon, who figured,
considerably more than a century later, in the reign of William the
Conqueror. The next thing heard of this Llewellyn is in 1018, when,
says Caradoc (<i>Hist. Wales</i>, p. 79), “Llewellyn ap Sitsylt having
for some years (<i>seventy-three</i>) sat still and quiet, began now to
bestir himself.” It was time!</p>

workman,” is the expression used, which the feudal ideas of a later
age naturally rendered <i>fidelis</i>; and an alliance, only lasting
for the life of Malcolm, was accordingly transformed into a regular
feudal transaction, existing for generations. The earlier authorities,
from the chronicle and Æthelward, make no mention of any such thing;
and Kenneth the Second appears to have been as ignorant of it when he
harried Cumberland in 971, as Ethelred when he wasted the same province
in 1000; nor could Simeon of Durham have been aware of such a compact
when he wrote that, in 1072, Malcolm the Third held Cumberland “Non
jure possessa sed violenter subjugata,” expressions which can scarcely
be reconciled with the uninterrupted possession of the province as a
feudal fief for 127 years. When John of Fordun compiled his history,
he eagerly seized upon the means of escaping the numerous claims for
homage put forward in the rival English chroniclers; and Cumberland, in
his pages, becomes the counterpart of the earldom of Huntingdon during
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Scottish king invariably
granting it to the heir, or tanist, who duly performs homage to the
Saxon monarch for the fief held of his crown. On one occasion a tanist
is called into existence for this sole purpose, and the veracious
historian, after fabricating the apocryphal being, is obliged to murder
his own creation to account for his not appearing amongst the Scottish
kings. The same <i>myth</i>, Malcolm, king of the Cumbrians, unites
with Kenneth the Second in witnessing a charter which the latter is
supposed to have signed as king five years before he ascended the
throne, and is very appropriately placed amongst the eight oarsmen who
manned the boat of Edgar in his apocryphal progress on the Dee.—<i>V.

the head of a different branch of the Hy Ivar. His father, Harald, who
was killed in Connaught in 940, was the son of Sitric <i>Mac</i> Ivar,
or the elder Sitric, who killed, or was killed by, his brother Godfrey,
and was the head of the Norsemen of Limerick. The power of the Limerick
Hy Ivar appears to have received a severe shock when Olave Godfreyson,

in early Scottish history, and generally in company with the men of
Moray. It has been frequently assumed that they belonged to a certain
earldom of the Merns, comprised in modern Kincardineshire, though
Mr. Skene (<i>Highlanders</i>, vol. ii., c. 9) places them on the
western coast, where he supposes that there once existed an earldom of
Garmoran. The same objection, I fear, may be raised against the earldom
of Garmoran which is urged against the earldom of the Merns—the
total silence of history respecting it. When a dim light is first
shed upon the northern provinces, the name of Moray, which must have
once been applied to the whole line of sea-coast—<i>Armorica</i>—in
this direction, is confined to the westward of the Spey, whilst the
eastern tract of country is broken up into the earldoms of Mar and
Buchan, and the districts of Strathbogie and the Garioch, both “in the
crown,” <i>i.e.</i>, conquered. The name of Mærne has by this time
disappeared, unless it still survived in <i>Mar</i>, representing only
a portion of the ancient province, but I should imagine it is to be
sought for in this quarter, which would account for the connection of
its people with the men of Moray; and if ancient Mærne once included
Kincardineshire, the name of “the Merns” may have been retained, like
that of Northumberland or Cumberland, by a comparatively small portion
of the original province.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> The principle of “the right of blood” latterly exercised
a social influence over the ecclesiastical as over the political system
of the Gaelic people, and bishops and abbots made their visitations and
exacted their dues amongst a population united to them, in a certain
sense, by the ties of kindred, whilst most of the superior offices
in a monastery became hereditary. Not that they were invariably held
from father to son, but the right of presentation to certain offices
becoming vested in certain families, the people grew by degrees to
be united to their abbots and other ecclesiastical dignitaries by a
similar tie of blood to that which bound them to their chiefs and
princes, and an abbot not chosen from one of the families of the
district in which his monastery was placed, would have appeared (in
an unconquered country) as great an anomaly as a chieftain or a king
of alien blood—an <i>ungecyndne cyning</i>. When, therefore, Kenneth
founded Brechin, which must undoubtedly have enjoyed the privilege
of <i>Cuairt</i> or visitation over the same extent of country as
was afterwards included in the diocese of that name, he must have
possessed the power of insuring to the abbot and his monks the free
exercise of their rights amongst the people of the district; in other
words (as he had not inherited it), he must have conquered it. Beyond
the territories over which the monastery exercised <i>Cuairt</i>, the
country up to the Dee was placed under the jurisdiction of St. Andrews,
the bishop of this diocese being the spiritual head of the conquests
of the kings of Scots—as in the case of Lothian, for instance—except
when it was otherwise arranged.</p>

Edgar, it is not to be supposed that he has escaped the claims of
the Norman writers, and accordingly, at a time when he was harrying
Cumberland, he figures in their pages as an attendant at the court
of Edgar at Chester, forming one of a a crew of eight “underkings,”
who in token of humble submission rowed the king’s barge in a
triumphal procession on the Dee. During another visit to the English
court at Lincoln, a crafty suggestion of the Scottish king about
the difficulty and trouble of defending Lothian, is rewarded by the
gift of the province as a feudal fief, to be held by various acts
of homage, amongst others on condition of carrying the crown on all
state occasions, whilst manors are provided to cover the expenses of
the royal vassal on his progresses towards the southern court! It
is curious to remark the tone of increasing feudalism pervading the
fabrications of each succeeding century. The composers of the fictions
about Kenneth and Edgar, which are only to be found in the later
chroniclers connected with St. Albans, have been even more than usually
imaginative, and their transparent fabrications remain as a warning to
the impartial historian to look with mistrust upon all claims connected
with such a tissue of anachronism and fable. <i>V. Appendix L</i>, pt.

it seems to have acquired an evil reputation, and Hrafn the Red, on
Sigurd committing it to his charge after the death of its first bearer,
refused to lift it, adding somewhat unceremoniously, “Bear thine own
devil thyself.”—(<i>Story of Burnt Njal</i>, c. 156.)</p>

comparing the passages of Simeon it is impossible to doubt that the
cession of Lothian by Eadulf Cudel was the result of the battle of
Carham, though there is an evident reluctance in the English chronicler
to allude to the defeat and its consequences. The men of the Lothians,
according to Wallingford, retained their laws and customs unaltered,
and though the <i>authority</i> is questionable, the <i>fact</i> is
probably true, for <i>Lothian</i> law became eventually the basis of
<i>Scottish</i> law. Conquest indeed in these times did not alter
the laws and customs of the conquered, unless where they come into
contact and into opposition with those of the conquerors, and the men
of the Lothians remained under the Scottish kings in much the same
position as the men of Kent under the kings of Mercia and Wessex,
probably exchanging the condition of a <i>harassed</i> for that of a

the editor inclines to the opinion that Malcolm the Third was the

successful northern wars of the latter king.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">[126]</a> Strathbogie and the Garioch were “in the crown” at
a later period, and before the reign of David, though it would be
difficult to say with certainty when these districts were annexed.
Moray was forfeited under David, and the summary manner in which that
king and his successors were able to deal with church property in the
diocese of that name, as well as in that of Aberdeen, discloses the
different relation in which the Scottish kings stood towards the people
of those bishoprics and towards the population of some of the other
dioceses. No Culdees appear struggling for their rights in the earlier
charters of Moray and Aberdeen (though in the thirteenth century the
Culdees of Monymusk tried to shake off the supremacy of St. Andrews),
a proof that the powerful Gaelic families in whom these rights would
have been vested, were either extinct, or so far reduced as to be in
no condition to offer any resistance to the measures of David. Such
was not the case in the bishoprics of Brechin and Dunblane, where the
Culdees held their ground long after the time of that king, owing
probably to a reluctance on his part, and on that of his successors, to
alienate their great feudatories, the earls of Strathearn and abbots of
Brechin, by an over prompt interference with Church property in their
possession. The tradition connecting Mortlach with Malcolm the Second,
has induced me to notice the annexations of these districts under this
reign, in which the royal authority may have been considerably extended
and consolidated in this direction, though I think it most probable
that the final conquest and submission of the province was the result
of the frequent and successful, though little known, northern wars of
Malcolm the Third, and the subsequent successes of his son Alexander
in the same quarter. The last Mormaor of the mysterious province of
Mærne appears in alliance with Donald Bane; the people of the district
attempted, in conjunction with the Moray men, to assassinate Alexander
at Invergowrie, and then nothing more is heard either of the Mormaor or
the men of Mærne; and I am inclined to connect with this disappearance
the forfeiture of the ancient family, and the distribution of the
ancient kingdom between Dee and Spey into the two subordinate earldoms
of Mar and Buchan, and the two lordships of Strathbogie and the
Garioch, long retained by a member of the royal family.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> There appears to have been the same difference amongst
the ancient Irish between the <i>Brugaidh</i> and the <i>Biotagh</i>,
as between the <i>Bonder</i> and <i>Landbu</i> amongst the
Scandinavians. The <i>Brugaidh</i> was originally the free or adopted
member of the Clan or <i>Cyn</i>, tracing his origin either really or
theoretically to the founder of the race, and hence entitled to his
free allotment, or <i>duchas</i>, of the tribe land; the freeholder,
in short, deriving his name from his <i>Brugh</i>, <i>Burh</i>,
or separate house, just as the <i>Bu-ander</i> (Bonder) from his
<i>Bu</i>—the <i>Hus-bond</i>; <i>V.</i> “<i>Hy Fiachrach</i>,”
<i>passim</i>. The Biotagh was the man who held his land by paying
<i>Biodh</i>—<i>Feorm</i> or <i>rent</i>—the colonus <i>Geneat</i>
or tenant farmer, dwelling in the baille or village. The Brugaidh
might have complained, like his type the Bonder, at a very early
period, of being changed into a Biotagh or Land-Bu—made to pay rent;
when his position must have somewhat resembled that of the Kentish
<i>Alodiarius</i> or Gaveller at the time of the Norman Conquest; but
after the English invasion all distinction between the two classes was
speedily forgotten, both merging in the <i>Villeinage</i>. In later
times, indeed, the Biotagh occasionally appears to have been of more
consequence than the Brugaidh, probably because members of the former
class might be holders of a far wider extent of land than the small
peasant proprietor, and of comparatively greater importance. Hence
the <i>Ard-Biotagh</i>, sometimes met with in the Irish annals, was
probably nothing more than “a great land-holder”,—the possessor of
many “benefices” held by payment of Biodh or rent.—<i>V.</i> Appendix

but it is very evident, I think, that they alluded to an institution
well known at least in tradition. The word <i>Toshach</i> simply
means “captain” or “leader”—<i>dux</i>; the Irish <i>Taisigeacht</i>
meaning “captaincy,” “leadership,” or “precedency.” When the office
of <i>dux</i>, originally elective, became hereditary, according to
the invariable principle of “divided authority” so characteristic of
all the Celtic communities, it remained permanently in the family of
the eldest cadet of the clan, the Tighern farthest removed from the
chieftainship. The “Captains of Galloway” and the “Thanes of Ross” were
probably known in their native tongue as <i>Toshachs</i>—captains
by right of office—for though the oldest cadet and the thane, in
his military capacity, were known as <i>Toshachs</i>, it by no means
follows that a Toshach was necessarily either one or the other.</p>

Duncan’s murder. The vision of a weary fugitive, a deserted king, rises
before the mind’s eye, recalling “Beaton’s mill” and the fate of James
the Third. Two hundred years after his death a chaplain was appointed
by his descendant, Alexander the Second, to celebrate masses in Elgin
Cathedral for the benefit of Duncan’s soul. No allusion is made in the
Saga to any alliance between Thorfin and Macbeth, and whilst the former
is described as collecting reinforcements from Ross, Sutherland, and
Caithness, Duncan retires upon Moray as a friendly province in which
he recruits his forces. Considering the hereditary enmity between the
Jarls of Orkney and the Mormaors of Moray, it seems more probable that
the ill fortune of the young king tempted Macbeth to aspire to the
crown, and to murder his rival in “the Smith’s bothy,” where he was
resting after retreating from the field of his last defeat. In the
Saga, Kali disappears after the battle and is heard of no more, from

confusion is thrown over the period of Macbeth by raising unnecessary
questions about his birth and his rights to the crown. All the best
authorities—his contemporaries Tighernach and Marianus, and the
Registry of the Priory of St. Andrews, which records his gift to the
Culdees of Lochleven—unite in calling him the son of Finlay, the
Register describing his wife as the daughter of Boedhe, whose claims
she inherited. Another difficulty is raised because Macbeth appears
as the immediate successor of Malcolm the Second in <i>Sim. Dun. de
Gestis</i>, 1034, contrary to every other authority. That this is an
error, of some transcriber apparently, is very evident, for the same
Simeon, in his History of Durham, l. 3, c. 9, calls Duncan the king of
Scots, adding that he was defeated before Durham in the fifth year of
Harald’s reign, <i>i.e.</i>, 1040, and soon afterwards slain by his own
subjects. The supposed relationship between Macbeth and Duncan may have
been grounded upon the real connection between the king and Thorfin,
with whom the Moray Mormaor seems to have been confounded in more ways
than one.</p>

Siward as the slayer of Macbeth and the restorer of Malcolm to the
throne of Scotland, at the command of Edward the Confessor, though the
Northumbrian earl died three years before the accession of the Scottish
prince. The ever ready pen of the Prior of Belvoir, to a literal
transcription of Florence, adds the words “de se tenendum,” to complete
the feudality of the transaction; the addition resting on grounds quite
as good as the rest of the story, which almost seems to have been

is the first to mention the popular story of Birnam Wood coming to
Dunsinnan, but he places the death of Macbeth at Lumphanan, attributing
it to “a knycht nowcht borne of wyf,” who is transformed by Boece into
Macduff. As Fife was “in the crown” in the days of Malcolm Ceanmore,
who granted the earldom to his son Ethelred, the Macduff Earl of Fife
of the fabulists—a being unknown to Wynton—must be set down as <i>a
myth</i>. Since the days of the younger Angus, the founder of St.
Andrews, the province appears to have been connected with the royal
family—the abbacy of the leading monastery of the district having been
held by Constantine the Second, just as the abbacy of Dunkeld belonged
invariably to a member of the house of Atholl—and the first earl,
who cannot be traced to the reigning family, was Dufagan or Duff, a
witness of the Foundation Charter of Scone in the time of Alexander
the First; his immediate successors being Constantine and Gillemichael
Macduff. Fife appears to have been the latest earldom held by the old
Scottish tenure, and its earls, like the earls of Atholl—a branch of
the reigning family—never appear in the ranks of the king’s enemies.
Indeed they may be looked upon in early times as premier Earls of
Scotland, with certain privileges attaching to their dignity, to
account for which the legend of Macduff was probably framed; though
it is not impossible that the earldom with its prominent position and
privileges was granted to the <i>historical</i> Duff or Dufagan as a
reward for his assistance in restoring <i>the sons</i> of Malcolm to
the throne. Many examples could be given of the <i>transposition</i> of
events from one period to another. A prominent one occurs in Norwegian
history, the whole of the actions of <i>Olaf Tryggveson</i> in England

son Duncan, as her first husband, Thorfin, survived till 1074, and
Duncan was knighted soon after 1072, when he must have been at least
fifteen years of age. But Thorfin died “in the latter days of Harald
Sigurdson,” whom his sons accompanied as Jarls of the Orkneys to the
battle of Stanford Bridge in 1066. Malcolm was married to Margaret in
1070, Duncan was not knighted before the death of the Conqueror, in
1087, when he must have been more than fifteen; and as five or six
years elapsed between the death of Thorfin and the marriage of Malcolm
to Margaret, I see no reason for doubting the account of the Orkneyinga
Saga, though many for hesitating to affix the stigma of illegitimacy
upon Duncan, whose donations to Dunfermlyn are confirmed by David

bishop nor the chronicler who records these proceedings appear to have
regarded them as extraordinary. <i>Sim. Dun. Twysden</i>, p. 79.</p>

of William’s probable route. He appears, however, to have forgotten
that all the early invaders of Scotland who combined a fleet with
their land force—and none else were successful—must have held their
course <i>along the coast</i>, or their fleet would have been useless.
Abernethy, according to Ailred, was <i>in Scotia</i> (<i>Twysden</i>,

succeeded in penetrating into the heart of the real kingdom of Scotland
that Malcolm came to terms.</p>

The homage of Malcolm would appear to have been <i>simple</i> not
<i>liege</i>, for he never seems to have been called upon to perform
any feudal service; whilst his subsequent repudiation of the demands
of Rufus shows that the homage was not rendered for the kingdom of
Scotland, but was simply the feudal recognition of his subsidy. In
short, the meeting appears to have resulted in a compromise, William
endeavouring to secure the peace of his northern borders by what in the
present age would take the form of a pension or subsidy, then conferred
as a feudal grant, for which Malcolm performed homage, giving up his
son as a hostage for his faithful observance of the treaty. <i>Vide

MacMalcolm, a son or descendant of Malcolm MacMalbride, the Mormaor of
Moray who died in 1029, reigned over the north of Scotland from the
death of Thorfin in 1064 to his own death in 1085. It is impossible,
however, that this Donald could have been the representative of Malcolm
of Moray, or he must have been Mormaor of that province in place of
Macbeth, Lulach, and Malsnechtan, of whom the latter died in the same
year as Donald, in the peaceful possession of Moray. Neither would
Donald have had any claim upon the crown, as he was not the heir of
Gruoch, and it is impossible that he could have reigned over the
north of Scotland for upwards of twenty years, whilst his kinsman
Malsnechtan, <i>the real heir</i>, was content with the province of
Moray. If the entry is correct it is just as possible that the words
“Donald, son of Malcolm king of Scotland” may apply to a son of
Malcolm the Third; but the word <i>Righ</i> in the Irish Annals is
very ambiguous, and ought to be translated <i>prince</i> rather than

expedition—as usual a gossiping mixture of truth and absurdity.
Malmsbury (l. 4, sec. 311) says that “William performed nothing worthy
of his greatness, whilst he lost many of his men and baggage-horses.”
Wendover, from his frequent literal transcriptions of Malmsbury,
must have had this passage before him when he wrote “venientes
igitur rex et frater ejus Robertus in Angliam, acies duxerunt in
Scotiam, unde Malcolmus <i>nimio terrore percussus</i> homagium regi
fecit Anglorum, et fidelitatem juravit,” (vol. ii., p. 37). In a
similar manner “that most authentic and valuable volume, the Book of
Abingdon,” (?) expands the short sentence in which Simeon describes
the abortive invasion of Scotland by Robert in 1080—“Cum pervenisset
ad Egglesbreth nullo confecto negotio reversus, etc.”—into the
following inflated narrative:—“Verum rex illi Lodoniis occurrens
cum suis, pacisci potius quam præliari delegit. Perinde ut <i>regno
Angliæ principatus Scotiæ</i> subactus foret, obsides tribuit. Quo
pacto inito Regis filius cum exercitu ad patrem hilaris repedavit”
(<i>Vide</i> <i>Appendix Q</i>). When the comparative failures of
Robert and William in 1080 and 1091 are thus misrepresented—failures
which were notorious, and admitted to be so by the contemporary
English chroniclers—what degree of confidence can be attached to the
inflated descriptions of the successes of the earlier English kings,
which are to be found in the same authorities? We can only judge by
<i>results</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">[173]</a> Malcolm was evidently taken by surprise. “He sent and
demanded the fulfilment of the treaty that was promised him. And the
king, William, cited him to Gloucester, and sent him hostages to
Scotland, and Edgar Atheling afterwards and the men returned that
brought him with dignity to the king. But when he came to the king he
could not be considered worthy either of our king’s speech or of the
conditions that were formerly promised him.” Such are the words of the
Saxon Chronicler, yet Malmesbury says (sec. 311), “Malcolm came of his
own accord to Gloucester, an earnest suitor for peace on equitable
conditions, but he obtained nothing, though he was permitted to return
in safety, as the king disdained to capture by fraud one whom he had
subdued by valour.” The safe conduct and the hostages detract something
from this much vaunted magnanimity, but Malmesbury would sacrifice a
good deal for the sake of a well turned period. The assertion which
Simeon and Florence have placed in the mouth of Malcolm conveys a
valuable piece of historical information, though it does not follow
that the king spoke <i>feudal Latin</i> because they have written it.
The presence and intervention of the leading nobles of both kingdoms
at meetings on the frontier implies the independence of both kings;
for if the king of Scotland had been the vassal of England <i>for his
kingdom</i>, he and <i>all his followers</i> would have been liable
to have been cited to the court of their suzerain at the will of the
latter, as actually happened in the reign of William the Lion. In
the convention between Rufus and Robert, twelve barons on each side
confirmed the agreement in token of the independence of both parties
(<i>Flor. Wig.</i> 1091). In the treaty between Richard and William the
Lion four barons appear in the same way on either side (<i>Fœd.</i>
vol. i., pt. 1, p. 50); and both Scottish and English nobles invariably
affix their names to the conventions between their kings, recorded so
often in the Fœdera. In attempting to force Malcolm to submit to the
judgment of the English barons when he had come to Gloucester on an
errand of a totally different description, William appears to have
been actuated principally by overweening arrogance, though he may also
have endeavoured to found a precedent injurious to Scotland; and it is
singular to mark how nearly all the English authorities accuse Malcolm
of “a breach of faith” because he resented the conduct of William,
whilst they pass over without notice the glaring “breach of faith” on
the part of their own king.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="label">[174]</a> Morel was king Malcolm’s “Godsib,” or, in other words,
they had stood Godfathers together. This bond of spiritual relationship
appears to have been thought a very sacred tie in those days, and to be
unfaithful to the <i>Godsib</i> was considered a heinous sin, at any
rate amongst the Gael; for the four Masters describe the state of the
country as peculiarly wretched when “there was no protection for Church
or Fortress, <i>Gossipred</i> or mutual oath.” <i>An. F. M.</i> 1050,

Both Malmesbury and the Saxon Chronicler imply that Malcolm lost his
life by treachery, and the account of Orderic, as usual a strange
mixture of truth and error, goes far to prove the existence of a
tradition to this effect. He is next said to have been slain at the
siege of Alnwick Castle, though it is more than doubtful if a castle
then existed on the banks of the Alne. From <i>Alnwick Castle</i>
the step was easy to the family so long connected with that border
fortress, and the Scottish king was at length said to have been slain
by a knight, who, issuing from the castle gate with the keys on the
point of his lance in token of surrender, suddenly <i>pierced the
eye</i> of Malcolm, acquiring from this feat the name of <i>Pierce
eye</i> or Percy! About two centuries after the fall of Malcolm an
improbable story was circulated at Tynemouth, that the body of a
peasant had been palmed off upon Alexander for that of his father,
<i>Mat. Paris Addit</i>, p. 129. The writer adds that Malcolm was
conquered “by order of Henry the First,” and winds up his account
of the deceit with these quaint words “ita delusa est <i>Scottorum
improbitas</i>.” The keen relish with which he enjoys the idea of
overreaching “<i>the Scotch rogues</i>” is amusing. Pleasures of rare
occurrence are sometimes supposed to be the sweetest.</p>

the Saxon Edgar, the Scottish Kenneth playing the part of the guilty
nobleman. The hunt was conducted “secundum legem venandi quam vulgus
<i>tristam</i> vocat.” An open plain, encircled by a belt of wood,
was the scene of the sport; a flowery hillock in the centre the place
of rendezvous for the sportsmen; whom Malcolm placed in different
commanding positions, ready to let slip their dogs upon the game as it
was driven by the beaters from covert.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_178" href="#FNanchor_178" class="label">[178]</a> The principal point which Margaret succeeded in
carrying out was connected with Lent, which the Gaelic Church kept
from Quadrigesima Sunday instead of from Ash Wednesday. The Gaelic
practice was long the universal custom, and it is still doubtful
who added the four days. Pope Gregory the Great speaks of <i>the
thirty-six days</i> of abstinence, though some maintain that he was
the first to begin Lent from Ash Wednesday, whilst others refer
the change to the time of Gregory the Second (<i>Bingham</i>, bk.
21, c. 1), in which they are probably correct, as the custom would
otherwise have penetrated into the Gaelic Church when it conformed
to the Roman practice in the days of Nectan and Ceolfrith. The other
practices which Margaret endeavoured to reform were—1. A reluctance
to communicate on Easter Sunday. 2. Labour on Sundays. 3. Marriage
with the widow of a father or brother. 4. The celebration of the
service with <i>barbarous rites</i>, or, in other words, in a manner
to which she was unaccustomed. In the latter point she seems to have
been unsuccessful, for the Culdees still continued to celebrate their
office <i>more suo</i> in the days of Alexander and David (<i>Vide</i>
Margaret’s Life by Turgot, c. 2). It is worthy of remark that Margaret
seems to have made no attempt to separate the Culdees from their wives;
and as numbers of the Anglo-Saxon clergy were married men at that time,
particularly in the provinces beyond the Humber, where the customs
of the Northmen were little interfered with, it is probable that she
did not consider their manner of life contrary to ecclesiastical
discipline. The system of Hildebrand did not penetrate into England
until after the Norman Conquest. In one of his Charters (<i>Ancient
Laws, etc., of England</i>, vol. i., p. 495) William says, “Sciatis ...
quod episcopates leges, quæ non bene nec secundum sanctorum canonum
precepta usque ad mea tempora in regno Anglorum fuerunt ... emendandas
judicavi.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181" class="label">[181]</a> This account of Margaret is entirely taken from her
life, written by her confessor, generally ascribed to Turgot, and I
think with reason. The writer was not her confessor latterly (c. 4),
and as Turgot entered into orders in 1074 (not 1084 as Papenbroch
says), and became Prior of Durham in 1087, six years before the death
of Margaret, this would agree very well with the theory that ascribes
the work to him. It must have been written in the reign of Edgar, as
the messenger who brought the news of Malcolm’s death to Margaret
was “the son who succeeded to the king”—not Duncan, who was neither
present at the battle nor was he a son of Margaret—and as <i>three</i>
sons succeeded, though the writer only alludes to <i>the son</i> who
succeeded, he must have written before the second son came to the
throne. <i>Vide</i> also <i>Hailes’ Annals, in loc.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_182" href="#FNanchor_182" class="label">[182]</a> Wherever the followers of Rufus were quartered, it was
their custom to burn everything that they could neither eat, sell,
nor carry off, whilst all that they could not drink in their orgies
they either spilled or used to wash their horses feet. “Quæ vero in
patresfamilias crudelia, quæ in uxores et filias indecentia fecerint,
reminisci pudet.” Hence the approach of the court was the signal for
the wretched inhabitants of the neighbourhood to fly to the woods, and
leave their houses to the mercy of their oppressors. Henry endeavoured
to repress the evil with the stern justice of his father, tearing out
the eyes of the perpetrators of such enormities, or punishing them by
amputation of the hands or feet. <i>Ead. Hist. Novell.</i>, l. 4, p.

to have been fortunate in his choice between the sisters. It may have
been the influx of ladies like the Scottish princess amongst the nuns,
that introduced the use of ornamented pins and gold rings amongst the
sisterhood, with the wreathing and dressing the hair, forbidden in
several subsequent councils. The words of Matilda convict Orderic of
one of those blunders which render that chronicler such a broken reed
to lean upon whenever historical accuracy is required. He says that
Count Alan of Bretagne sought the hand of Matilda <i>from Rufus</i>,
“sed morte præventus non obtinuit,” (l. 7, p. 702). As Alan died on the
19th October 1119 (<i>L’Art de verifier les Dates</i>, vol. ii., p.
897), it is difficult to conceive how his death could have prevented
his marriage with Matilda, who had then been eighteen months in her
grave (she died 1st January 1118), after having been the wife of Henry
the First since November 1100! Alan’s first wife died in 1090, and
he re-married in 1093, before Matilda could have sought refuge in
England, for Malcolm was alive until the 13th November in that year.
Alan, however, was once a suitor for the hand of Matilda, but to her
father Malcolm (according to her own words) not to Rufus. This is the
little grain of truth which, as usual, lurks in an infinity of error;
for Orderic seems to have retailed all the gossip of the day, generally
contriving to get hold of a wrong version of the story.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> Matilda appears to have been very amiable, very devout,
very fond of music and poetry, very vain, and rather pretty; not a
perfect, but a feminine and loveable character, which earned her the
title of “Good Queen Maud.” The feeling which prompted her aversion to
the unbecoming black hood is easily to be traced in the character which
Malmesbury has left of her (<i>Gesta Regum</i>, l. 5, sec. 418), though
the good Queen would have forgiven serious offences sooner than the
lukewarm praise accorded by that writer to her personal charms, “haud
usquequaque despicabilis formæ.” Like most of her family she died in
the prime of life.</p>

Ethelred took advantage of a mist to convey the body of his mother out
of the west gate before her death was generally known. The good prior
was as ignorant of any divine agency on this occasion as Turgot was
unconscious of any pretentions on the part of his royal mistress to
supernatural gifts; but in the account of Fordun, l. 5, c. 26, the body
of Margaret is conveyed through the host of Donald Bane under cover of
a miraculous mist “That a mist on the Firth of Forth should be held
miraculous,” remarks Lord Hailes, “must appear to the inhabitants of
the Lothians a strange example of prepossession and credulity.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> Boece palliates the usurpation of Donald by
attributing it to the detestation—to use the words of his translator
Bellenden—“of the pepil at the riotus and intemperat manneris brocht
amang thaim be Inglismen;” the same high authority enumerating amongst
the virtues of David that “he ejeckit the vennomus custome of riotus
cheir quhilk was inducit afore be Inglismen.” David probably introduced
the Norman habits, for at this period the Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Danes
were renowned for their love of “riotus cheir,” though they were hardly
the corrupters of the austere morals of the ancient Scots. Robert de
Mellent is said to have introduced the custom of one meal a day from
Constantinople, for his health as he affirmed—for his niggardliness,
as was grumblingly insinuated by the hungry Saxons, who loved to
recall the jovial days when Hardicanute set four meals a day before
his overfed dependants, and rejoiced to see the dishes carried away
full, because his followers could literally eat no more. There may have
been some truth in the complaints of the Saxons, for the Normans, with
many high qualities, were a hard and close race in all that concerned
money. “The vennomus custome of riotus cheir” among <i>Inglismen</i>
is again attributed by Lambarde entirely to the corruptions of the
Danes, probably with equal justice; and upon their shoulders must
the blame rest, till some Yorkshireman, or other denizen of ancient
<i>Danelage</i>, vindicates the character of his ancestry at the
expense of some other scapegoat.</p>

Alexander, and David. He also relates an anecdote which he heard from
David, that whilst that prince in his younger days was in attendance
at the English court, he received a sudden summons, when amongst his
companions, to repair to the presence of his royal sister. He found
the Queen engaged in her evening occupation of washing the feet of a
number of lepers, and pressing the feet of each leper to her lips as
she completed the ceremony. Matilda invited her brother to follow her
example, but he excused himself, not unnaturally expressing a doubt
whether the royal Henry would approve of the manner in which his Queen
bestowed her favours. Matilda did not press the subject, and David
rejoined his companions. Wendover has copied this anecdote, dating it
in 1105.</p>

l. 5, c. 36. <i>Lib. de Scone</i>, ch. 1. I have principally followed
the account of Wynton. It was evidently the object of Alexander to
bring the men of Moray and Mærne to an engagement where his mounted
followers could act with effect, whilst it was equally the aim of his
enemies to attack the king at a disadvantage, which they calculated
upon doing if he attempted to cross by the usual ford. It was from
no mere reckless bravado that Alexander swam across, at an unguarded
spot probably, and at full tide, when he was least expected, thus
out-manœuvring the enemy and falling upon them in the open country.
Swimming a river was no uncommon feat amongst the heavy-armed soldiery
of those days. Robert of Gloucester swam the Trent before the battle
of Lincoln, when the fords were impassable from floods. Fordun (or
Bowyer), frightened perhaps at the idea of the king and his men-at-arms
swimming the Moray Firth, places the battle at the Spey, and divides
the honour of the feat with Sir Alexander Scrimgeour. He and Boece
are eloquent about the escape of Alexander from the treachery of one
of his chamberlains in league with the enemy; but Wynton knew nothing
of the tale, which probably rests on a very doubtful foundation. Mr.
Skene (<i>Highlanders</i>, vol. i., p. 129) has attributed the attack
on Alexander to Ladman, a son of Donald Bane, on the strength of the
following entry in the Ulster Annals under the year 1116. “Ladmunn
M. Dom. h ... righ Alban killed by the men of Moray.” But Ladman son
of Donald, <i>grandson</i> of ... king of Alban, can scarcely be a
description applicable to a son of Donald Bane; and the word now lost
must have been the name of Ladman’s <i>great grandfather</i>, not the
<i>designation of his father</i>. Donald Bane appears to have left no
son, for both Wynton and the Comyn pedigree in the Fœdera, represent
Bethoc as his heiress. Ladman also appears to have been at enmity
with the Moraymen; but who or what he was must remain a matter of
conjecture.</p>

MS. quoted in Selden’s preface to Twysden p. 6, “Electus fuit Turgotus

elevation of Toledo into the Metropolitan see of Spain, by Urban II.,

be quoted as instances. The state of the Papacy in the early part
of the eleventh century had been scandalous. In 1012 Benedict VIII.
obtained the see through the influence of his kinsman the Marquis of
Toscanella, one of a family which had influenced the elections of the
bishops of Rome for upwards of a century. His brother John XIX. fairly
bought the Papacy, and was in the same day a layman and the head of
the Roman Church. Similar means obtained the election of his nephew,
Benedict IX., a mere child, who after scandalizing Rome with his
excesses, retired in favour of Gregory VII., who was in turn deposed
for simony on account of the bribe by which he procured the abdication
of Benedict. The latter then again reappeared to contest the popedom
with two German bishops, Clement II. and Damascus II.; and after their
deaths the Romans appealed to the emperor against the threatened
intrusion of Benedict for the third time, and the papacy was conferred
upon Leo IX. In allusion to the influence of Hildebrand, his great
friend the Bishop of Ostia wrote the following lines:—</p>

In short, Eadmer is continually insinuating the venality of the papal
court, though of course the practice of corrupting the Roman clergy
was strictly confined to the partizans of York, and never extended to
the purer clergy of Canterbury. The latter, however, are represented
in a very different light in the pages of the Yorkist Stubbs, who does
not hesitate to charge them with forgery and the perpetration of every
species of dishonesty against the immaculate clergy of York. Henry the
First stands out in honourable relief, for when Pope Calixtus pressed
him to break his promise to the Archbishop of Canterbury, assuring the
king that he would grant him absolution, Henry replied with dignity
“that it would be inconsistent with the honour of a king to agree to
any such proceeding; for who would put any faith in a promise, if
the royal example taught them how easily it could be set aside by
absolution.”</p>

Madach of Atholl, Malise of Strathearn, Dufagan of Fife, and Gartnach
and Rory, who may be assigned to Angus, Mar, or Buchan. Heth appears
to have married the sister of Malsnechtan (for his successor, Angus,
is described as the son of Lulach’s daughter, <i>An. Ult.</i> 1130),
and thus to have inherited and transmitted the claims of the line
of Kenneth MacDuff. He must have been an inveterate opponent of the
reigning family, as his son Malcolm is described by Ailred as “the
inheritor of his father’s hatred.” The real descent of the Stewarts was
well known as late as the fourteenth century, when Richard Fitz-Alan,
Earl of Arundel in 1336, sold the Stewardship of Scotland to Edward
III., a transaction which was confirmed by Edward Balliol (<i>Tiernay’s
Hist. of Arundel</i>, vol. i., pp. 193, 299, <i>notes</i>). The sale
was of course a political fiction, founded on the assumed forfeiture
of the Scottish branch of the earl’s family, through which their
hereditary office was supposed to have reverted to their English
connections. The real king and the pseudo-king united in the joint
exercise of an act of shadowy sovereignty—a joint protest of their
claims as vassal king and overlord of Scotland—the sole substantial
gain, the purchase-money, falling to the earl; though, had the
Plantagenets succeeded in conquering Scotland, the transaction would
have become a reality, and the ancestry of the hereditary Earls Marshal
of the present day would have lost their claim to supplant the ancestry
of the reigning sovereign. The father of <i>Alan</i> was Flahald or
<i>Fleald</i>, a name which reappears under the familiar form of
“<i>Fleance</i>, son of Banquo, Thane of Lochaber.”</p>

and <i>Thanage</i> are supposed to be, not Saxon <i>names</i>
applied to Scottish institutions, but actual Saxon institutions
introduced beyond the Forth, it should be explained why the Saxon
Thane was as totally different a character from the Scottish Thane
as <i>Thane-land</i> was from a Thanage. The Saxon held by military
service—<i>cnicht</i>-service, an expression scarcely traceable
to Normandy; the Scot by <i>Scottish</i> service and rent—in

The account of Orderic is, as usual, a strange mixture of truth and

its holder to the earldom at this period, whilst the holder of an
honour was “overlord”—or constable—of a number of knights and barons;
for all the tenants of an honour held by military service, and with
manorial rights. It was in the power of the king, however, to grant

Ailred. A comparison between the Priors of Hexham and the Continuator
of Florence, will show the difference between the chronicler who lived
in the neighbourhood of the scenes he describes, and he who, a tenant
of a distant monastery, probably relied upon hearsay evidence. The
battle of Northallerton was naturally a disagreeable subject for the
Scottish chroniclers. Wynton, with characteristic honesty, says “the
Scottis ware discomfyt and mony ... in depe lowchys drownyd was.”
Fordun, Major, and Buchanan, divide the battle into two, perhaps
from some confusion with the fight at Clitheroe. At the battle of
Northallerton the English are routed; but in the following year the
Scots, through despising their enemy, who are in great numbers, receive
a check at the Standard. Boece, with a soul above such half-measures,
stoutly claims a victory, ransoming the English leader, <i>the Duke
of Gloucester</i>, at an enormous sum! <i>Ford.</i>, l. 5, c. 42.

<p><a id="Footnote_248" href="#FNanchor_248" class="label">[248]</a> By old, and probably universal, custom, every freeman
was bound to attend the “hosting across the frontier” once every year
in arms. By Charlemagne’s law, all holders of benefices were bound by
their tenure of military service to come, and all <i>Frank-allodial</i>
proprietors of three, four, or five <i>mansi</i> (or <i>hydes</i>);
every proprietor of an amount less than three <i>mansi</i> combining
with others, so that the lowest on the list, the proprietor of half a
<i>mansus</i>, in conjunction with <i>five</i> others (<i>i.e.</i>,
making up <i>three mansi</i>) equipped one of their number for the
army. The equivalents of this latter class amongst the English seem
to have formed the <i>gemeinred</i> or yeomanry. A less numerous,
but a better armed, and probably a more orderly body of men, would
be furnished by the Imperial law than by the older custom, which was
preserved in Scotland under the name of <i>Scotticanum servitium</i>,
sometimes known as <i>forinsecum servitium</i> (<i>Reg. Morav. Cart.
Orig.</i> 13), the <i>Sluagh</i> or “hosting beyond the frontier.”
The muster of the Highland clan in later times, including “Native
men” as well as “Duine Uasal,” answered to the old <i>Sluagh</i>. The
expressions <i>Inware</i>, and <i>Utware</i>, are sometimes used, the
former answering, apparently, to the Welsh “Llwyd yn Wlad,” or hosting
<i>within</i> the borders; the latter to the “Llwyd yn Orwlad,” or
hosting <i>beyond</i> the borders. It may be gathered from <i>Reg.
Morav. Cart. Orig.</i> 17, that “Scottish service” was rendered on
foot and without defensive armour. “Non habemus jus habendi aliquod
servitium de domino Willelmo de Moravia nisi <i>forinsecum servitium
Scotticanum</i> domini regis ... et secursum ac auxilium quod nobis
in defensione regni per potenciam suam <i>armigerorum et equorum et
armorum</i> fecit ex libera voluntate sua.” The Thane of Tullibardine
had assisted his lord, the Earl of Strathearn, with men-at-arms,
horses, and armour, which he was not bound to do in return for his
Thanedom, held by Scottish service alone. The arms required for
Scottish service were probably those with which the Clans Hay and
Qwhele fought on the North Inch (<i>Reg. Morav.</i>, p. 382), bows,
axes, swords, and daggers, with the addition of the long Scottish
spear. The arms of the native Irish in the days of Cambrensis appear
to have been a spear, two javelins (resembling the old German
<i>framea</i>), and a formidable battle-axe introduced by the Northmen.
They gloried in fighting without defensive armour, like Earl Malise.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_260" href="#FNanchor_260" class="label">[260]</a> It is singular how Wimund has been confounded, by
nearly every historian down to the present day, with Malcolm MacHeth.
Newbridge, who relates his adventures at length, l. 1, c. 23, 24, and
who had often seen him in his blindness and captivity at Biland, merely
says that he was born at some obscure spot in England, and pretended
to be “a son of the Earl of Moray.” Ailred (quoted in <i>Fordun</i>,
l. 5, c. 51) also alludes to him as an impostor, “Cum misisset ei Deus
inimicum quemdam pseudo-episcopum qui se filium Comitis Moraviensis
mentiebatur,” and again (Dominus regem) “monachi cujusdem mendaciis
flagellavit.” But in l. 8, c. 2, Fordun treats MacHeth himself as an
impostor, “erat enim iste Malcolmus filius MacHeth, sed mentiendo
dicebat se filium Angusii Comitis Moraviæ.” Here begins the confusion;
but it can be clearly shown that Wimund and MacHeth were totally
different persons. Malcolm MacHeth, “the heir of his father’s hatred,”
was captured in 1134 and confined in Roxburgh Castle until 1157,
when he was liberated by Malcolm the Fourth and attested one of the
Dunfermlyn Charters (<i>Ailred</i>, p. 344. <i>Chron. Mel.</i> 1134.
<i>Chron. St. Crucis</i> 1157. <i>Reg. Dunf.</i> No. 40). Wimund could
not have gone to Rushen, at the very earliest, before the year of its
foundation, 1134; he was a monk before that date, and could not have
been made bishop until after the imprisonment of MacHeth. From an
entry in Wendover under 1151, “Eodem anno Johannes ..... factus est
secundus antistes Monæ insulæ ..... Primus autem ibi fuerat episcopus
Wimundus ..... sed propter ejus importunitatem privatus fuit oculis et
expulsus,” it may be gathered that the career of Wimund was brought to
a close <i>at least six years</i> before the liberation of MacHeth, and
the Bishop of Man, who probably enacted his singular vagaries about
1150, may have personated the son, the brother, the nephew, of the
<i>real claimant of the earldom</i>—or even that very claimant—but
it is impossible to identify him with the solitary captive in Roxburgh
Castle without attributing to one, or both, ubiquity.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="label">[261]</a> <i>J. Hexham</i> 1152. In the words of Newbridge (l. 1,
c. 22), “aquilonalis regio, quæ in potestatem Domini regis Scottorum
<i>usque ad fluvium Tesam</i> cesserat, per ejusdem Regis industriam
in pace agebat.” Wynton, therefore, was justified in saying (bk. 7, c.
6, l. 241), “In swylk dissentyowne De kyng Dawy wan till his crown All
fra the Wattyr of Tese of brede North on till the Wattyr of Twede, And
fra the Wattyr of Esk the Est, Til of Stanemoor the Rere-Cors West.”
The Esk was the river flowing into the sea at Whitby, and Stanemoor is
on the borders of Yorkshire, Durham, and Westmoreland. As late as 1258
a bishop of Glasgow claimed jurisdiction as far as “the Rere-Cross,”
and singularly enough he was an Englishman (<i>Chron. Lanerc.</i>
1258). Camden (<i>Brit.</i>, p. 987) mentions the Brandreth Stone
in Westmoreland as a meer-stone between Scots and English; but it
probably was only a boundary of the lands held by the Scottish kings
near Penrith. Alice de Rumeli was the daughter of William Meschines
and Cecilia de Rumeli, who founded the Priory of Emmesey, which
Alice removed to Bolton. <i>Vide</i> Bolton Priory Charters, <i>Dugd

Sutherland,” were made over to the Earl of Ross by Robert Bruce in
1308. (<i>Acta, etc.</i>, p. 117). The name of <i>Dingwall</i> tells of
the Norsemen, and Ross is frequently claimed for the Jarls of Orkney in

<p><a id="Footnote_273" href="#FNanchor_273" class="label">[273]</a> In 1275–6 Alexander II., and subsequently, in 1372,
Robert II. confirmed a grant by which Niel, Earl of Carrick, had
conferred upon Roland de Carrick, “ut ipse et heredes sui sint capud
tocius progenie sue, tam in calumpniis quam aliis articulis et negotiis
ad <i>Kenkynoll</i> pertinere valentibus,” with the office of Bailliary
(Seneschalship) of the Earldom of Carrick, and “<i>the leading of
the men thereof</i>,” under the earl and his heirs (<i>Robertson’s
Index</i>, 134. 6). The earldom went to Niel’s grandson, Robert Bruce.
So MacDougal of Dunolly, the male heir of the <i>de Ergadia</i> family,
was hereditary Bailie of Lorn. “The MacDuff” seems also to have been
the next of kin to the Earl of Fife for the time being. The office of
Tanist must have become obsolete when the heir was declared by the
Probi homines of the Visnet instead of by the Kin. A royal grant,
very similar to that of the Earl of Carrick, was in one celebrated
case the cause of a feud lasting for centuries. As the <i>Toshach</i>
seems originally to have been the second personage in the clan, so the
<i>Senior</i> often appears to have monopolized the ecclesiastical
preferment. The kings of the MacAlpin race were Cowarbs of St. Andrews;
of the Atholl family, Cowarbs of Dunkeld; the Earls of Ross were
descended from “Mac-in-Sagart”—the priest’s son—and it is highly
probable that the older chiefs of Clan Chattan and representatives
of Gillie-Chattan-More were also “Cowarbs of St. Chattan.” When the
clan, after the breaking up of the confederacy of Donald Balloch, made
its peace with the king, the headship was, for some unknown reason,
conferred, not on the <i>Senior</i>, but the <i>Toshach</i>, and
accordingly a constant state of hostility existed between the Captain
of Clan Chattan by royal grant—“the Mac-in-<i>Toshach</i>”—and
the claimant of the chieftainship by right of blood—“the
Mac-in-<i>Pherson</i>,” filius personæ, or son of the Cowarb. The
Macphersons are neither mentioned amongst the “Landislordis and
Bailies,” nor “the Roll of Clans” appended to “the General Band;” but
only amongst “the brokin men of the surname of Macinpherson.” (<i>Col.
de Reb. Alb.</i>, p. 35, <i>et seq.</i>) Nothing but the tenacity with
which the “old Clan Chattan” clung to their “chiefe” (<i>do.</i>, p.
207) could have prevented a family, representing, probably, the ancient
line of MacHeth, from sinking to the condition of <i>Og-tiernach</i>
under a junior branch.</p>

<i>Probus</i> has passed into the French language as <i>Preux</i>;
probus homo, as <i>Preud-homme</i>. They are continually found in the
Frank laws and capitularies as <i>Meliores pagenses</i>, the class
furnishing the <i>Scabini</i>, the <i>Mediocres</i> of some of the
other early laws. In <i>burghs</i> they were the class from which
echevins, bailies, and aldermen were chosen. They represented the
leading members of all that part of the <i>communitas</i> which was
not comprised in the clergy, greater barons, and royal officials,
answering very much to the class from which in modern times—whether
<i>in burgh</i> or <i>upland</i>—the grand jury, magistrates, and
members of Parliament are supposed to be chosen. Amongst the old
Saxons the <i>Scepenbar</i> man—he who was qualified to be chosen
for a <i>Scabinus</i>—was required to be “probus, prudens, indigena,
ingenuus, et quatuor avis natus, liber et opulentus;” in other words,
the qualifications for a <i>Probus homo</i> were supposed to be birth,
property, and character. In the old Scottish laws the <i>probus
homo</i> is always rendered “good man”—and the <i>gude-man</i> is
still the equivalent of “the master” in a certain class—the <i>probus
homo et fidelis</i>, “the good man and true,” being a man of a
class superior to the simple <i>fidelis</i> or “<i>leal man</i>.”
The <i>good</i> equally appears in his equivalents amongst the
Welsh,—the <i>Gwr dha</i> “bonus homo;” and amongst the Spaniards—the
<i>Hidalgo</i>, “fijos d’algo,” or “filius boni hominis.” Amongst the
Northmen he appears seemingly as the <i>Danneman</i>, and amongst the
Irish Gael as the <i>Saoi</i>. The Scabinus derived his name from
the same source as the <i>Scop</i>; both were <i>Makers</i>—to use
the old English word answering exactly to ποιητης—and in times when
an unwritten code was preserved in the memory by such verses as “the
father to the bough, the son to the plough;” by a sort of <i>memoria
technica</i> like the Welsh Triads; or by a quaint system of question
and answer, as is traceable amongst the Irish; the qualifications to
constitute a good “law maker” may have often produced a good “maker” of
poetry.</p>

joined in the combat to make up the necessary number of combatants,
and escaped with life, he ranked as a <i>full-born</i> member of the
kindred for whom he had entered the lists. In the battle on the North
Inch of Perth thirty men appeared on each side, armed with bows,
axes, swords, and daggers, but without defensive armour. The number
resembles the triple oath of “three Thanes and twenty-seven leil men,”
by which the lord of the prison from which a thief escaped was bound
to clear himself; the equipment was probably that required in the old
“Scottish service.” It is generally supposed that the contest was for
the chieftainship of the Clan Chattan, but it seems very doubtful that
this was the case. The oldest account of the battle, which took place
on 28th September 1396, is contained in a memorandum in the <i>Reg.

thirty of the <i>Clan Qwhwle</i> “quia firma pax non poterat intra

<i>Folk-mote</i> was probably the meeting of the whole people in early
times, but after a king’s Ealdorman presided at it, it was surely only
a meeting of the <i>Folk</i> under his special jurisdiction. It is
last alluded to in the laws of Athelstan, being replaced probably by
the biennial <i>Shire-gemote</i> provided by Edgar’s laws, in which
the Bishop and the Ealdorman were the leading personages (<i>Edg.</i>
ii., 5. C.S. 18). These <i>Moots</i> had nothing whatever to do with
the government of the kingdom, which was vested in the king and his
<i>Witan</i>,—his Court or Privy Council, not his Parliament; for
the voice of “the Community” was unheard in the <i>Witanagemote</i>.
Self-government up to a certain point is traceable in the institutions
of this period, but not beyond it. The Londoners might choose their
Tything-men and manage their own affairs, but the right to do so
was laid down in “the ordinance which the Bishops and <i>Reeves</i>
belonging to London ordained;” the Reeves being appointed by the Crown,
and Bishops, Reeves, and Ealdormen being answerable for holding the
<i>Frith</i> “as <i>I and my Witan have commanded</i>” (<i>Ath.</i>
v. 11). It is in vain to attempt to trace the germs of the English
parliamentary system in the Anglo-Saxon Witan. Our modern Parliament
was gradually developed out of the right, acknowledged by “Norman
feudalism,” of the whole community of freeholders to gather round the
sovereign. The <i>Majores Barones</i> still exercise the right, once
belonging to the whole community, of assembling in person; the lesser
barons, and the rest of the community, whether <i>in burgh</i> or
<i>upland</i>, assemble by their representatives, chosen originally
by “the Reeve;” but from the reign of Henry IV. (who appears to have
finally carried out the intentions of his grandfather, after a lapse of
thirty years), by all freemen of a certain standing. The government of
a king and his Witan—his Court or Privy Council—could only have been
developed in course of time into, either a powerful but irresponsible
despotism, or a feeble monarchy torn by the dissensions of a few
powerful magnates contending for the real power. Such was the phase it
assumed in England, unless the history of that period is gravely in
error.</p>

about Mortancestrie and Novel Disseisin is correctly ascribed to David,
it would be not a little remarkable, for the change was only introduced
into the English law by Henry the Second, according to the highest
testimony, Glanville (l. 1, c. 11–21, <i>quoted by Blackstone</i>).
Such changes generally travelled northwards, and will be found in
England before they took root in Scotland. Thus the attempt of James
I. to establish a representative system amongst the lesser freeholders
in Scotland is surely traceable to his residence in England, where a
similar system was actually established by Henry IV. The regulation
ascribed to David, however, is not identical with “the Grand Assize,”
which was constituted by appointing four knights in every sheriffdom,
who were to choose twelve others. By the Scottish law such questions
were to be decided by the ordinary “Assize of the good country of
twelve men.” By Welsh law all questions relating to succession to
property were to be decided by the <i>Henduriad Gwlad</i>—the senior
<i>Gwrdha</i>, or good men of the country—the judge pronouncing
according to their decision, which was known as <i>Dedfryd Gwlad</i>,
or the verdict of the country (<i>Wootton</i>, l. 2, c. 10). Whether
this regulation was original, or derived from the principle introduced
by Henry II., I cannot say.</p>

optional for the parties to choose the Wager of battle or the Verdict

to determine whether this must be regarded as a fragment of Galloway
law, or as one of those retrogressions which were incidental to
the state of Scottish society after the English wars. The <i>Quon.

<p><a id="Footnote_316" href="#FNanchor_316" class="label">[316]</a> As the founders of the Norman kingdoms southward of the
Alps were ignorant of the hereditary feud; as no charters are traceable
in the Norman duchy until many years after the Conquest; and as the
charters by which the Anglo-Normans held their English possessions were
unquestionably framed upon the Anglo-Saxon model; it would appear as
if such documents, familiar to the Anglo-Saxons, were comparatively
unknown to, or unused by, their conquerors. In the thirteenth century,
when Earl Warenne was called upon to produce the title by which he
held his lands, he laid his sword upon the table; nor can the few
remaining holders of lands, which their ancestors possessed at the date
of Domesday, show any other title than that of the great Earl. Yet
are we generally told that the Normans oppressed the Anglo-Saxons by
the introduction of novel feudal tenures. <i>Sac</i> and <i>Soc</i>,
<i>Tol</i> and <i>Team</i>, <i>Infangthief</i> and <i>Outfangthief</i>,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_317" href="#FNanchor_317" class="label">[317]</a> The charters will be found in the Introduction to
“Robertson’s Index.” The witnesses, all of whom have Saxon or Danish
names, are sometimes supposed to represent the Scottish Court; and
the total absence of all Gaelic names is assumed as a proof of the
total exclusion of the native race from the court and councils of
their sovereign. But this total absence is in itself suspicious. Where
are the Gaelic Earls who were invariably the first to attest the
great charters of Alexander and David? In the Foundation Charter of
Dunfermlyn, David confirms the grants of his father Malcolm, his mother
Margaret, and of his brothers Duncan, Edgar, Ethelred, and Alexander;
all of which must have been made according to “ancient custom,” or
the charters, would have been forthcoming in the Dunfermlyn Registry;
and as the sole known charters of Duncan and Edgar are connected with
Durham, whilst their grants made beyond the Forth were not confirmed
by any written document, it would appear as if these Durham charters
had been written and witnessed <i>at Durham</i>, and that no argument
can be drawn from the names of the attesting witnesses about the
composition of the Scottish Court. The title of “Basileus Scottorum,”
applied to Edgar, will never be found in any Scottish charter, but it
occurs frequently in Anglo-Saxon documents. It was the policy of the
Scottish kings of that period to keep up a connection with Durham;
and it must be always recollected that there was less difference
between the Angles separated by the Tweed, than between the Angles and
Anglo-Danes separated by the Tees. The chosen standard of David—the
Dragon of Wessex—speaks volumes of the pretensions which the sons of
Margaret were very ready to keep alive amongst a population, which was
not included in the Domesday survey.</p>

been the original bond of union in burghs—defence against the Moors,
for instance, in Spain; but where the Goth and the Roman had dwelt,
in a certain sense, on an equality long before they amalgamated, an
intramural population, with Roman traditions and Roman law, must have
existed many a year before it was recognised as a separate “Estate” in
return for defending towns against the infidel. In the great German
Burghs the <i>Traders</i> were originally a separate class from the
<i>Burghers</i>, and the distinction is still traceable in those
regulations of the Scottish burghs which denied admittance to the Guild
privileges to all who worked at certain trades with their own hands.
What was the previous condition of the Traders—what their state before
their town became a <i>Burh</i> with privileged defenders, amongst
whom they were gradually enrolled? At the best, it must have resembled
that of other <i>Fiscalini</i>, and few “full-born” Teutons could have
entered willingly into such communities until they went as free and
privileged defenders of a <i>Burh</i>, rather than as members of a
class which they looked upon as inferior and unprivileged. Their arms
and their free rights they carried with them—the one was identical
with the other in the olden time—becoming free members of a civic, as
they had previously been of a rural association, and following such
civic occupations as were not considered derogatory to the dignity of a
Freeman. Germanic law long ignored written documents, and the customs
of the Burgh were mostly in accordance with that older allodial system
which the progress of Roman innovation stamped as <i>Roturier</i>.
Men possessed property in land long before it was secured by written
documents, and many a burgh had been in the enjoyment of rights and
privileges by unwritten law long before it was thought necessary to
obtain the sanction of a feudal charter, which must no more be regarded
as necessarily creating a new burgh, than as necessarily introducing
a foreign settler into Scotland, and eradicating a native proprietor.
In both cases the charter was often only confirmatory of pre-existing
rights. But it would be erroneous to imagine that the Teutonic Burghs
ever existed as independent associations against “the tyranny of the
noble class.” Some notice of such a state of society, had it existed,
would surely be traceable in the regulations of the Carlovingian era.
It was this very class, lay or ecclesiastical, who joined with the
sovereign in building <i>Burghs</i> for defence, or introducing free
burghers into towns which had hitherto been unfree and comparatively
defenceless. The spirit of antagonism arose with the increasing
power of the greater burghs. In England the <i>Burgh</i> arose out
of the necessities of the Danish invasion; and if a Teutonic element
existed previously amongst the resident intramural population, it was
scarcely on the footing of Burgh-<i>Thegns</i>. There is no word in
the Anglo-Saxon language expressive of a free and trading community
associated within walls. The <i>Burh</i> was originally the place
of strength, and the inhabitants of <i>Bebba’s Burh</i> were surely
not traders. <i>Wic</i> is a very vague word, and <i>Ceaster</i>
unquestionably of Roman origin. The latter is the word most often
found in the translation of Beda—as in London-<i>Ceaster</i>, and
<i>Eofer-wic-ceaster</i>—and as the <i>Wealh</i> remained at the
basis of the population in the rural districts, a similar element
probably supplied the bulk of the inhabitants of the <i>Ceaster</i>
before its conversion into a <i>Burh</i> introduced the Teutonic
<i>Burh-Thegn</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_327" href="#FNanchor_327" class="label">[327]</a> <i>Leg. Burg</i> 70, 71. The <i>Hanse</i> was simply
that kindred association, known as the <i>Hant-Gemahl</i>, without
which no Teuton seems in early times to have been entitled to “free
right.” (<i>Appendix F.</i>) The Northerns carried with them into
the <i>Burh</i> their old customs, this association amongst the
number. A <i>Hanse</i> seems strictly to have been an association of
<i>four</i>; there were <i>four</i> classes of towns in the great
Hanseatic League, of which Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck, and Cologne were
“the Four Burghs.” When Roxburgh and Berwick fell into the hands
of the English, Lanark and Linlithgow were added to complete the
necessary number of <i>four</i> Scottish Burghs. The <i>Northern</i>
Burgh seems to have been simply the reproduction of the rural system
within the walls, the Burgh-Thanes, or probi homines, of London, who
chose their <i>Tything-men</i> and <i>Hynden-men</i>—representing
the <i>Tuns</i>-men of the country districts—who also chose their
<i>Head-borough</i> and Hundred’s Ealdor. Neither originally chose
their <i>Gerefa</i>. I cannot look upon the Northern Burgh as
simply a repetition of the Roman city, or the Roman city, with its
Roman customs, enfranchised, and its citizens, living by Roman law,
converted into burghers. The <i>Hanse</i> was scarcely Roman, but
it was a necessary ingredient in the <i>free right</i> of every
“full-born” Teuton. “Bare is back without brother behind it,” says the
old northern proverb. The <i>Echevin</i> was a thoroughly Teutonic
personage, the Scabinus, or <i>Scepen</i>, of the rural district; and
wherever such features are traceable “in-burgh,” I must look upon the
original burghers, not as a trading class enfranchised, but rather
as a class of free Teutons introduced <i>above</i> the traders for
defence—carrying arms for the defence of the country being the mark
of freedom—and introducing with them the free <i>allodial</i> customs
of the rural districts. The Anglo-Saxon Burgher, and the member of the
great Hanseatic Burghs of northern Germany, were thoroughly Teutonic
personages, owing little, if anything, directly to Rome and her
municipal institutions, in early times, I should imagine.</p>

this provision—it eliminated the servile element from amongst the
burgherhood. A native-man might run away from his district, but how
could he take with him the property to purchase a burgage-tenement?
<i>Stock</i> was his property, and it is difficult to conceive how he
could carry the stock with him, or sell it, unknown to his lord, with
all the machinery of witnesses and warrenter required for sales and
purchases. But it is easy to imagine how the settlement of native-men
in the towns may have been encouraged by their lords as a source of
private profit. The whole trading class was once probably on such a
footing, and the greater the wealth acquired by the trader, the more
would he have paid for permission to remain away from his district—for
he was not necessarily a <i>slave</i> in the modern acceptation of
the word, but “inborn” to a certain district, from which he could not
separate himself without his lord’s permission. He who settled in a
town, and prospered in his unfree condition, if he aspired to become
a free burgher, must, in all ordinary cases, have bought his freedom
from his lord—as in the case of Renald <i>prepositus</i> of Berwick in
1247—and after enjoying his tenement for a year and a day no further
claim could be raised against him. <i>Vide Scotland in the Middle
Ages</i>, p. 142. It was admission to the Guild in a Free burgh that

<p><a id="Footnote_341" href="#FNanchor_341" class="label">[341]</a> The date 432 is usually assigned to the arrival of St.
Patrick in Ireland. There is nothing by which the real accuracy of
this date can be tested, and it wears a very suspicious appearance,
as if it had been originally fixed upon to favour the usual story of
Patrick’s ordination by Pope Celestine, who died in that year. One
of the earliest traditions about the Irish Saint—that contained in
Nennius—couples “Bishop Germanus,” with Pope Celestine, and “Victor
the Angel of God,” as the originators of Patrick’s mission, adding,
that Germanus sent “Bishop Severus” with Patrick. <i>Severus</i> was
the companion of Germanus in his second expedition into Britain. In the
old poem ascribed to Fiech (given by O’Connor as above, p. xc.) Patrick
is said to have remained in southern Gaul and studied the Canons with
<i>Germanus</i>. The fable of the Angel Victor is evidently founded
on the following passage in the <i>Confession of Patrick</i>:—“Et
ibi scilicet vidi in visu, nocte, <i>virum</i> venientem quasi de
Hiberione, <i>cui nomen Victoricius</i>, cum epistolis innumerabilibus,
et dedit mihi unam ex illis, et legi principium epistolæ continentem
Vox Hiberionacum.” The saint’s dream of the arrival of the human
Victoricius from Ireland with a letter, bearing the prayers of the
Irish to convert them, was magnified in after times into the miraculous
appearance of the angel Victor from heaven.</p>

Celestine deputed Germanus at the instance of Palladius (<i>Chron.</i>
429). Constantius of Lyons, in his life of Germanus, never alludes to
the Pope, but attributes the mission of Germanus and Lupus to a Council
of Gallican Bishops, assembled on account of the representations of
the British Church. Beda, who must have had both accounts before him
(for he quotes from both authorities), has literally transcribed
the narrative of Constantius; and as he must have had some reason
for this preference, I do not feel inclined to dissent from the
venerable historian. Some clue may perhaps be afforded to the reasons
for such opposite versions of the same story, by the remark of the
Benedictine compiler of <i>L’Art de verifier les Dates, etc.</i>, “Ce
pape (Zozimus) l’année précédente (<i>i.e.</i>, 417) avait accordé le
Vicariat du Saint Siege dans les Gaules à Patrocle, Evêque d’Arles;

proceeding which the Gallican Bishops would have been unwilling, at
that time, to admit.</p>

about thirty years afterwards. It is curious to contrast the numerous

Martin. The dedication of the churches of Canterbury, Whithern, and
Hereford, with the Irish Abbey at Cologne, to St. Martin, together with
“the Gospel of St. Martin,” long preserved at Derry, and supposed to
have been brought from Tours by St. Patrick, attest the veneration in
which the name of the founder of monachism in Gaul was held throughout
Britain and Ireland in early times.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348" class="label">[348]</a> The Bishops of the Gaelic Church were ordained in
the usual manner. Thus Finan, when he ordained Cedd, called in two
other bishops to assist in performing the ceremony—<i>Beda, Hist.
Eccl.</i>, l. iii., c. 22. But many probably were chorepiscopi, at
whose ordination it was only requisite for one bishop to officiate. It
was this order, long suppressed and forgotten in the Roman Church, that
scandalized Lanfranc, Anselm, and others, in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries. That the leading bishops of the Gaelic Church at this time
were regularly ordained, may be inferred from the fact that there is no
allusion to any <i>re-ordination</i> of bishops at the time when the
Churches of Scotland and Ireland were remodelled. Perhaps “the dignity
of Noble Bishop” (Uasal Escop., <i>Vide A. F. M.</i>, 1106), may
allude to the superior or episcopal order, as opposed to the inferior
or chorepiscopal. The want of a fixed diocese must have contributed
to impress the Irish bishops with that character for wandering which
was so much complained of in the ninth century. Bishops without a
diocese, however, were not confined to the Irish Church, as at a much
later period, Olaf the Saint had his “Hird-Bishop,” whose peculiar
duties must have attached him to the royal household. The necessity of
episcopal ordination for the priesthood is implied in the story related
of Columba by Adamnan, in his life of that saint. Upon hearing that
Findchan, a priest, had “laid his hands” on the head of Aodh Dubh, to
complete the ordination which the bishop had refused to proceed with,
Columba exclaimed, “Illa manus dextra quam Findchanus, <i>contra fas
et jus ecclesiasticum</i>, super caput filii perdicionis imposuit,
mox computrescit.” Much information about the early Irish Church is
contained in Dr. Reeves’ <i>Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Down</i>,
etc., <i>Appendix A</i>. The custom of Iona, in the seventh century,
as described by Beda, seems to have resembled the ancient custom of
the Church of Alexandria, by which, “not the bishops, but twelve
presbyters were the electors, nominators, and (according to Eutychius)
consecrators.—(<i>Stanley’s East. Church</i>, p. 266, note 2.) These
twelve presbyters are very like the twelve Culdees who formed, as it
were, <i>the Staff</i> of every Gaelic monastery.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_349" href="#FNanchor_349" class="label">[349]</a> As tithes were unknown, as <i>a fixed payment</i>,
in Gaul for some time after the mission of St. Patrick, it is not
surprising that the Scots and Irish were ignorant of them in the
twelfth century. It was the custom of Aidan and his followers to build
churches “per loca” (<i>Bed. Ecc. Hist.</i>, l. 3, c. 3), which appear
to have been dependant on the monastery of the district. Thus, on
the foundation of the regular diocese of Aberdeen, the monastery of
Mortlach, with five churches and their lands, was made over to the new
see. <i>Reg. Aberd.</i>, vol. 1, p. 5, 6. From the same Registry, p.
lxxvii., it appears that the <i>Cuairt</i> was eventually compounded
for by the payment of <i>Procurationes</i>.</p>

Chailleach (the nun), not to kill cows. 3. Cain Adomnan, not to
kill women. 4. Cain Domnaig, or Sunday law. The <i>Riar Patraic</i>
(Patrick’s demand) is explained by Tighernach (<i>ad an.</i> 986), to
mean <i>Cuairt eitir Cill ⁊ Tuaith</i>, “the Right of Visitation over
Church and State” (or over Clergy and Laity). Dr. Reeves’ preface to
“<i>Primate Colston’s Visitation</i>,” <i>IAS.</i>, contains very full
information on the subject of the early Irish Visitations. Inmesach
is said to have introduced the custom in 721 (<i>Tigh.</i>), a few
years after the Northern Irish, Pictish, and Scottish Churches had
relinquished their early Cycle and Tonsure. The Cuairt was probably
unknown to Patrick or Columba.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_352" href="#FNanchor_352" class="label">[352]</a> The first allusion to a Herenach occurs in <i>Tigh.</i>
605, <i>An. Ult.</i> 604, <i>A.F.M.</i> 601, but the office is not
again met with before the close of the eighth century. <i>Vide</i>
Mr. O’Donovan’s <i>Note O</i> to <i>A.F.M.</i>, 1179; though the
description of the Herenach there quoted from Sir John Davies—paying
a yearly rent to the Bishop, a fine upon the marriage of his daughter,
and a subsidy to every Bishop on his first entry into the diocese;
in other words, holding in fee-farm, with <i>merchet</i>, and
relief, or payment for a renewal of his lease—applies rather to his
character after the English settlement had reduced <i>Cowarbs</i> and
<i>Herenachs</i> to a very different footing from their position in
early times. The name of <i>Aircinneach</i>, meaning <i>Princeps</i>,
“Head of the Kin,” or <i>Overlord</i> (<i>Reeves, Adamn. N.</i> p. 364,
note M), points to a high position. In a charter of the time of Otho
I., dated in 952, a Count Hohold founds a convent, of which his sister
is to be the first abbess, that dignity being always to be filled
by a member of his race as long as it exists. He appoints himself
<i>Advocatus Monasterii</i>, stipulating that the office should also be
hereditary in his family (<i>Ducange in voc. Advocatus</i>). In Gaelic
phraseology, then, the family of Hohold were hereditary <i>Cowarbs</i>
and <i>Herenachs</i> of the monastery founded by their ancestor. The
<i>Advocatus</i> first made his appearance in the church about the
beginning of the fifth century—“post consulatum Stilliconis” (<i>Lind.
Gloss. in Advocatus</i>), and the “tertia pars bannorum et tertius
denarius” were amongst his privileges. From “Colton’s Visitation” it
is evident that the old <i>Termon</i>, or Church lands, were divided
into three portions, two belonging to the rector and his vicar, and
the remaining <i>third</i> to the Herenach under the Bishop, to whom
also belonged the “blood-fines,” or <i>Eric</i>, <i>the overlord’s
prerogative</i>. From a charter quoted by Harris, c. 35, p. 233, it
would appear that in the <i>Anglo-Irish</i> period, the <i>Rector</i>
was often identical with the <i>Cowarb</i>, so that the two-thirds
belonging to the Rector and Vicar represented the Abbot’s portion
of the Termon lands; and as in the <i>Gaelic</i> period the Bishop
had no claim on the temporalities of the Church, it seems probable
that the Herenach was originally the <i>lay-lord</i> of the Termon
lands, holding them of the Abbot by the usual tenure of retaining <i>a
third</i> of the fines and profits—tertia pars <i>bannorum</i>, et
tertius denarius. After the Cowarbs became very generally laymen, they
retained their portion of the Termon lands in their own hands, under
the superintendence of their own stewards and deputies, and the office
of Herenach, declining in importance, probably fell into the hands of
less exalted members of the family. When the Gaelic Church system was
superseded, the Herenach lands—Church lands held by a layman—appear
to have been confiscated to supply an income for the Bishop, the
former holders losing all their former claims upon “the thirds,” and
retaining only that small portion of the land which was their actual
<i>duchas</i>, or freehold; whilst as the families of the greater
Cowarbs were generally very powerful, they were often, probably,
allowed to retain the <i>patronage to the Rectory</i> in their family,
provided it was presented to an ecclesiastic.</p>

VI. <i>Rer. Hib. Script. Vet.</i>, vol. 2, p. 162. In the British
monasteries the monks devoted themselves to manual labour, as at
Bangor (<i>Bed. Hist. Eccl.</i>, l. 2, c. 2); but the Irish monks
were generally of the <i>contemplative</i> order, as at Louth, the
monastery of Mochta, the disciple of Patrick (<i>Tigh.</i> 534).In this
they strictly followed the rule of St. Martin, in whose monastery at
Tours contemplation was the business of the senior monks, whilst the
younger brethren were employed in writing. <i>Vide Sulp. Sev. Vit.
St. Martin</i>, c. 7. The contemplative life long continued to be
the characteristic of the Gaelic monks. The Gallican Liturgy (Cursus
Gallicanus) appears to have been in general use both in the British
and Gaelic Churches; and according to an old MS. quoted by Usher,
<i>Prim.</i> p. 185, it was introduced by Germanus and Lupus. The
diversity of Rules remained to astonish the Papal Legate in the twelfth
century, who mentions a singular fact that shows how deeply wedded the
Irish monks must have been to their peculiar Rule. “Quid enim magis
indecens aut schismaticum dici poterit, quam doctissimum unius ordinis
in alterius Ecclesia idiotam et laicum fieri” (<i>Usher’s Sylloge</i>,
p. 77); by which the Bishop of Limerick seems to imply that the
ordination of one order of monks was not acknowledged by another. This
tendency to cling to a particular Rule was probably amongst the causes
which led to the predominance over the Bishop of the Abbot, whose
special duty was to preserve strictly the Rule of the Founder. There
is no trace of any such narrow prejudice in favour of “the Rule,” as
that to which Bishop Gillebert alludes, to be found in the early Gaelic
Church.</p>

To throw two copies of the old and the new systems into a fire, to
test which would remain unburnt. 2. To shut up two monks in a burning

the dead and abide by his decision. Laisren declined the trial through
fear of Fintan’s superior sanctity; and, at any rate, the two monks
must have felt relieved by his humility. Cummian, however, appears to
have been totally ignorant that any such alternatives were offered to
Laisren during the Synod of Lethglin; for he represents the arguments
of the principal opponent of the new system (whom he hesitates not to
stigmatise as <i>a whited wall</i>) to have been based upon an appeal
to the traditions and practice of their forefathers. <i>Usher Brit.

<p><a id="Footnote_356" href="#FNanchor_356" class="label">[356]</a> The <i>Cowarb</i> was supposed to be the successor
of the earliest abbot, or <i>ecclesiastical</i> founder of the
monastery; but in process of time he appears rather to have been the
representative of the <i>lay</i> founder, or, in other words, of the
prince or chieftain who granted the Termon lands to the monastery.
Thus most of the Cowarbs of St. Patrick (or Abbots of Armagh) can be
traced to one of the various families of Oirgialla, of which race was
Daire, who originally granted to St. Patrick the land for founding the
monastery (<i>A.F.M.</i>, 457); though in the ninth century the Hy Nial
made several attempts to obtain the appointment for their own nominees.
The whole monastery gradually became filled with “Founder’s kin,” and
each leading family appears to have possessed <i>the patronage</i> of
the monastery of the district. Nor was this custom confined to the
Gaelic Church, for it existed in Wales, Bretagne, Auvergne (<i>vide</i>
Goodall’s Preface to Keith), and in many parts of England, where the
sons of priests were accustomed to inherit their father’s churches.
<i>Vide Ead. Hist. Nov.</i>, l. 3, p. 67. Instances still exist of
the union of ecclesiastical and temporal power; for the Vladika of
Montenegro is invariably the bishop, as well as the prince, of his wild
country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_357" href="#FNanchor_357" class="label">[357]</a> The word <i>Culdee</i> signifies nothing more than
clergyman, and it was the general name for the clergy amongst the Gael.
The Culdees can be traced in Ireland, just the same as in Scotland, and
they were replaced by regular canons in the same manner. The Oratories
and Culdees of Armagh are mentioned <i>A.F.M.</i> 919, <i>An. Ult.</i>
920. The Oratories were probably the seven churches, or chapels,
which appear to have belonged to all the larger Gaelic monasteries,
and the Culdees were the officiating ministers. The Prior and Culdees
of Armagh retained many of their privileges down to the Reformation.
Culdees were the ministers of York Cathedral, from the date of Oswald’s
foundation until after the Conquest; and they probably inherited their
privileges from the time of Bishop Aiden. <i>Vide Ware’s Antiquities
(Harris)</i>, vol. 1, p. 236. The old canons of Durham were exactly
in the same position as the Irish or Scottish Culdees. They were the
descendants of the bearers of St. Cuthbert’s body during the early
Danish wars, inheriting their canonries by right of blood, and claiming
to elect the bishop from their own body. In short, the see was in the
hands of certain privileged families until the Anglo-Saxon Church
beyond the Humber was remodelled after the Conquest. <i>Vide Hist.
Dun. (Twysden)</i>, l. 2, c. 6; l. 3, c. 6, 18. It is worthy of notice
that <i>a Hospital</i> is generally to be found where Culdees can be
traced to have existed, and this hospital is generally dedicated to St.
Leonard.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_358" href="#FNanchor_358" class="label">[358]</a> The power of the monastery depended very much on that of
the chieftain of the district, and varied accordingly. Thus, in early
times, Clonmacnois appears to have claimed the tribute of Connaught,
though the primacy was eventually transferred to Tuam. Like St. Andrews
in Scotland, Armagh had become far the most powerful abbey in Ireland
in the twelfth century.</p>

to <i>Fordun</i>, l. viii. ch. 73, Earl Gilbert gave a third of his
earldom to Inch Affray, a third to the bishopric of Dunblane, and only
retained a third for himself and his heirs; and the same earl is often
described as the <i>Founder</i> of the see. In a strict sense this is
doubtful, for Dunblane was undoubtedly amongst the <i>nine</i> Sees
existing, according to Ailred, at David’s death; and the poverty of
the bishopric five years after Gilbert’s death, in 1223, hardly agrees
with the supposed donation of a third of his earldom. Inch Affray was
the Foundation of Gilbert, upon which he lavished the tithes of his
<i>Can</i>, his rents, his fines, and his offerings. Yet that the
bishopric was endowed by the earls is a certainty, because in 1442
James II. declared, that the temporalities of the bishopric, hitherto
held of the Earl of Strathearn, were henceforth to be held of the
Crown. When the Pope granted to the Bishop a fourth of the tithes of
the whole diocese for the support of himself, a Dean, and Canons, the
Bishop seems to have abandoned “all right of pension out of the lands
or churches of the Earl of Menteith,” who was permitted to found a
house for Regular Canons at Inch Mahomoc, making over the church of
Kippen to found a Canonry in Dunblane Cathedral, and the church of
Callander for the Bishop himself. This arrangement wears very much the
appearance of a compromise; as if, at the revival of the see, David had
assigned the earldoms of Strathearn and Menteith to the bishop as his
diocese, neither of the earls, in the first instance, resigning the
church-lands in their possession, until the Earl of Menteith waived all
claim to the <i>patronage of the See</i>, in return for the permission
to found the <i>family</i> Priory of Inch Mahomoc; whilst the bishop
waived all further claim upon the earldom of Menteith, in return for
the churches of Kippen and Callander. The diocese was thenceforth
confined, in point of fact, to the earldom of Strathearn, in which all
its temporalities were situated; and in return for the patronage of
the see, no longer disputed by the Earls of Menteith, the successors
of Gilbert would have no longer had any reluctance to carry out his
intentions.—<i>Vide Innes’ Sketches, etc.</i>; <i>Inch Affray</i>, pp.
204 to 219. In earlier times each earl would have placed his bishop in
the family establishments of Inch Affray and Inch Mahomoc.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_369" href="#FNanchor_369" class="label">[369]</a> <i>Vide Goodall’s Preface to Keith’s Catalogue of
Bishops.</i> When David revived the See of Brechin, he merely granted
to the Bishop and Culdees the right of holding a Sunday market in
their <i>Vill</i> of Brechin. The Church-lands, originally “given
to the Lord” by Kenneth II., were probably in the possession of
the <i>Cowarbs</i>, long represented by the lay Abbots of Brechin.
Leod is the first known member of the family, attesting charters of
David, as “Abbas de Brechin,” amongst the laity; and the form of
<i>Abbe</i> so often appears after the names of the family, that it
has been taken for a surname; though, as the same individuals appear
with <i>Abbas</i> or <i>Abbatis</i> appended to their names, it is
evidently only a contraction. Morgund appears to have been the last
direct heir-male—(<i>Reg. de Brech. Pref.</i>, p.v., and No. 1.
<i>Reg. Vet. Arbr.</i>, No. 1, 70, 72, 73, 74—1, 2, 3). About the
opening of the thirteenth century, other clerks appear in the Chapter;
and as the charters quoted by Goodall mention “the Prior, Culdees, and
<i>others</i> of the Chapter of Brechin,” it is possible that these
“<i>others</i>” were the Canons, who now began to share the privileges
of the Culdees. The latter disappear towards the close of the reign of
Alexander II., and their place is supplied by the ordinary “Dean and
Chapter.” Morgund died in the same reign, and the property appears to
have passed to Henry, an illegitimate offshoot from the royal family,
who transmitted the name of <i>de Brechin</i> to his descendants. In
a charter, about the year 1267, his son, William de Brechin, couples
with the name of his father Henry that of his <i>mother</i> Juliana.
In 1232 Alexander granted certain lands to Gillandrys Mac Leod, to be
held by the service of one knight, “saving the rights of the clergy of
Brechin, and the annual rent of 10 <i>solidi</i>, due from a portion
to the Abbot of Brechin,” together with other lands, to be held <i>per
forinsecum servitium</i>, “infra dictum servitium unius militis.”
From all this, I think, it is allowable to suppose, that on the death
of Morgund the king bestowed Juliana, the heiress of the last Abbot,
on his kinsman Henry, with the proviso that the Culdees should be
suppressed, or converted into the Chapter, at the same time erecting
the lands of Gillandrys, the heir-male, hitherto held of the Abbot
and Clergy, into a barony, held by charter of the Crown.—<i>Reg. de
Brech.</i>, Nos. 2, 3; <i>Innes’ Sketches</i>, etc., p. 156.</p>

Wishart, afterwards Bishop of Glasgow, was also a Culdee—a clericus

Every papal confirmation, however, in the <i>Reg. Prior. St. And.</i>
proves that the right of electing the bishop was confined to the
Canons Regular of the Priory, the Culdees apparently having first been
deprived of their right in the days of Turgot (<i>Twysden, Preface</i>,
p. vi.) The expressions of Fordun can, therefore, only be explained on
the supposition that they had recovered their original privileges for a
short time about this period.</p>

this point, is easily rectified. As Olave Godfreyson died in 1152,
after a reign of forty years, he must have succeeded in 1112. Lagman,
who was king at the time of Magnus Barefoot’s expedition, reigned
seven years, which, added to the six years of Sigurd’s rule in the
Orkneys, places his death thirteen years after that of his father,
which occurred in 1095—or in 1108. The remaining four years are
accounted for by Donald’s regency, and the interval before the arrival
of Ingemund.</p>

is described in a passage redolent of the spirit of the age:—“Dedit
ecclesiis insularum terras et libertates, et erat circa cultum divinum
devotus et fervidus, tam Deo quam hominibus acceptabilis, propter quod
isti domestico vitio Regum indulgebant.” The privileges of Furness
Abbey were confirmed by a Bull of Pope Celestine, quoted in <i>Camd.
Brit.</i>, p. 1450. Wimund is one of the bishops called into existence
by Stubbs, to be consecrated with the apocryphal Michael of Glasgow, by
Archbishop Thomas of York, who died in 1114—(<i>Twysden</i>, p. 1713).
It is scarcely necessary to point out the discrepancy of this date with
the real period of Wimund’s adventures, as detailed by the contemporary
Newbridge. Wendover calls Wimund the first Bishop of Man, and he is
probably right in a certain sense; for the bishopric seems to have
been revived or remodelled, as in the cases of Glasgow and Galloway,
when Olave solicited a colony of monks from Furness; and as the Irish
Northmen looked upon their bishops as members of the Anglo-Norman
rather than of the Irish Church, Olave would naturally turn to the
Archbishop of York to consecrate the first bishop of his newly-created
diocese, which soon afterwards became dependant upon the Archbishop of
Drontheim.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_386" href="#FNanchor_386" class="label">[386]</a> <i>Newbridge</i>, l. 2, c. 4. Hoveden, a confidential
servant of the English king, distinctly states that Henry made oath at
Carlisle that if he ever ascended the throne of England, he would make
over to David and his heirs Newcastle and Northumberland, and allow
the kings of Scotland to possess without reserve all the lands between
Tyne and Tweed (<i>ad an.</i> 1148–49). Diceto, who had no object in
favouring the Scottish claims, says as decidedly that Northumberland
had not only been long in the possession of David, but that it had
been granted and confirmed to him by charter (<i>ad an.</i> 1173).
Newbridge is more guarded, remarking that Malcolm might have brought
forward the oath which Henry <i>is said</i> to have sworn—<i>ut
dicitur</i>—to David. John of Hexham does not allude to the agreement,
for it was probably kept secret, and could hardly have transpired when
he closed his history four years later; but he incidentally confirms
its existence when he states that the Earl of Chester waived his claim
upon Carlisle in favour of David, receiving the Honor of Lancaster in
exchange, for which he performed homage to the Scottish king. At this
time, then, Carlisle must have been the acknowledged property of David,
and the homage of Ranulph in connection with the Honor of Lancaster,
the subsequent claim raised by William in 1196 upon the same fief, and
the grant of Furness to Wimund, look very much as if Lancashire, or
its northern frontier, was also in the hands of David. His authority,
however, extended far beyond the Tyne, and the possession of the
castles of Carlisle, Bamborough, and Newcastle, goes far to prove
that whilst he held all beyond that river in the name of the Empress
Queen, he had stipulated that the earldom, which he looked upon as
the rightful inheritance of his wife, should be permanently made over
to himself and his heirs. Small facts are sometimes significant, and
as most of the important meetings between the English and Scottish
kings were held near their mutual frontiers, it is worth noticing that
though Henry subsequently met Malcolm at <i>Carlisle</i>, the cession
of the northern counties was made—<i>at Chester</i>. The possession
of the northern counties was a matter of grave importance to both
kings, for had they been held hereditarily by the Scottish princes,
they would from their local position have undoubtedly become gradually
incorporated with the Scottish kingdom. It was naturally the policy
of the English kings to throw every obstacle in the way of such a
contingency, and in estimating Henry’s conduct on this occasion, it
would be the safest course for those who seek to palliate it, to ground
their defence on the plea of “expediency.”</p>

<i>Wendover</i> 1157. Matthew of Westminster, far better informed than
any contemporary authority, fabricates an invasion of England in order
that Henry may be introduced as “vigorously repulsing” the Scots.
This recalls the practice of some of the earlier chroniclers, who
invariably raise a rebellion of the Scots at the commencement of every
fresh reign, that they may easily and effectually crush the revolt
with the same weapon that raised it—the pen. To the fiefs surrendered
by Malcolm according to the contemporary authorities, Wendover adds
“the whole county of Lothian,” a passage appearing also in Diceto; but
I have given my reasons in <i>Appendix L</i>, pt. 2, for regarding
it as an interpolation upon the “Imagines Historiarum,” and of no
authority in either case. The meaning of a reservation in Malcolm’s
homage, “salvis dignitatibus suis,” has occasioned some controversy,
and has sometimes been considered equivalent to a reservation of the
independence of his kingdom. I should be more inclined to regard the
saving clause as applicable to all those points which, at the time of
William’s homage to Richard at Canterbury, were left for the decision
of four barons of each kingdom, and subsequently confirmed by a charter
from the English king. Compare <i>Appendix L</i>, pt. 2.</p>

question was probably about the nature of the homage rendered for
Huntingdon, whether <i>liege</i> or <i>simple</i>. Liege <i>homage</i>,
which was the tenure by which the English kings held their duchy of
Guyenne—as Edward the Third admitted after some demur (<i>Fœd.</i>
vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 765, 797, 813)—carried with it the obligation of
liege <i>service</i>. The service of Malcolm, and subsequently of
William, in the armies of Henry, established the fact that they held
Huntingdon by <i>liege homage</i>; and the obligation of service was
subsequently evaded by sub-infeoffing the fief, which imposed this duty
upon the <i>Vavassor</i>, or tenant of the Holder in Chief.</p>

seem to have been amongst the most influential of the old Gaelic
Mormaors, the former always staunch supporters of the reigning family,
of which, perhaps, like the Earls of Atholl, they were a branch—for
both these earldoms, connected with the monasteries of Dunkeld and
St. Andrews, were originally “in the crown;” whilst the latter, who
were “Palatines,” exercising the privileges of a Regality within
their earldom, and with the patronage at one time of the Bishopric of
Dunblane—apparently, like the Ealdormen of Northumbria, “mediatized
princes”—will be generally found at this period at the head of the
discontented, rather than the disaffected, Scots. Ferquhard never
seems to have suffered for his share in this conspiracy. He was either
too powerful, or, more probably, not personally disaffected towards
the reigning family, but discontented at their innovations. As the
earldom of Ross, of which a certain Malcolm was in possession at one
period of this reign (<i>Reg. Dunf.</i> No. 43), was granted as part
of the dowry of the princess Ada on her marriage with Florence, Count
of Holland, in 1162 (<i>Doc. etc. Illust. Hist. Scot.</i>, iv. sec. 5,
p. 20), it must have been at that date in the crown; and if through
forfeiture, the forfeited earl may have been one of the “Mayster
Men.” Mr. Skene adds the Earl of Orkney and the Boy of Egremont on
the authority of Wynton and the Orkneyinga Saga, but I can find no
mention of either. The Saga only says that all the Scots wished to have
for their king William <i>Odlingr</i>—the <i>Atheling</i>—son of
William Fitz Duncan, alluding most probably to the repeated attempts,
in the succeeding reign, of Donald MacWilliam, generally known as “Mac
William,” and sometimes called “William” in <i>Ben. Ab.</i> Six years
before the conspiracy of Perth, the Boy of Egremont was old enough to
witness a charter of Bolton Priory, as son and heir of his mother,
Cecilia de Rumeli (<i>Dugd. Mon.</i>, vol. 6, p. 203), and as he
died in his childhood—he was the hero of the well-known tale of the
<i>Strides</i>—he was probably dead before 1160. In the conspiracy of
Perth, Mr. Skene sees an attempt of the “Seven Earls” to assert their
privileges and choose the son of William Fitz Duncan in the place of
Malcolm. These earls and their privileges are as profound a mystery as
the conspiracy itself. <i>Vide Appendix S.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_390" href="#FNanchor_390" class="label">[390]</a> <i>Chron. St. Crucis</i> 1160. The names of Fergus and
his son, Uchtred, occur amongst the witnesses to the grant of Perdeyc
on the 7th July 1136. <i>Reg. Glasg.</i>, No. 3, 7. The different
relation in which Galloway stood to Scotland in the reigns of David
and his successor, is clearly ascertained through its bishopric.
Candida Casa was not amongst the sees revived by David, owing its
reestablishment apparently to Fergus, Christian, the first bishop of
the new see, being consecrated in 1154, when the ceremony was performed
by the Archbishop of Rouen at Bermondsey (<i>Chron. St. Crucis</i>
1154). He was claimed as a suffragan of York after the captivity of
William, and when excommunicated in 1177 by Cardinal Vivian, legate
for <i>Scotland</i>, Ireland, and the Isles, for not attending a
council of Scottish bishops, was sheltered by his metropolitan, at
that time legate for <i>England</i>; and his successors remained
suffragans of York until the fourteenth century. It may be gathered,
therefore, that at the date of the revival of the see, Galloway was up
to a certain point an independent principality, the Scottish claims
to superiority dating from the conquest of Malcolm, the English from
the captivity of William—for Gill-aldan, consecrated with other
<i>myths</i> by Archbishop Thorstein, is an apocryphal creation of
Stubbs (<i>Twysden</i>, p. 1720). The bishopric, which was probably
commensurate with the boundaries of the principality, comprised the
modern shires of Wigton and Kirkcudbright westward of the Ure, and was
bounded by the deaneries of Nith and Carrick, both in the diocese of
Glasgow; the former the original seat of the Randolph family, whose
first known ancestor was Dungal of Stranith; the latter erected into a
separate earldom for Duncan, the grandson of Fergus, on resigning all
claim upon his father Gilbert’s share in the province of Galloway.</p>

Rhys of South Wales was in England with Henry in 1164, after the
expedition in which Henry reached Pencadair, which is usually placed in
1162. It is singular that Newbridge, the principal authority for the
Welsh wars, should not have alluded to the homage at Woodstock. Sir
Francis Palgrave, in his “Proofs and Illustrations,” seems to lay some
stress on the omission of the saving clause, “salvis dignitatibus,” in
the homage said to have been rendered by Malcolm to the younger Henry
on this occasion. It was simply a repetition of his original homage,
not a fresh act; and as he was in the enjoyment of his “dignities” at
this time, where was the necessity of the saving clause?</p>

(<i>Highlanders</i>, vol. 2, p. 167) seems to think that the Moraymen
took advantage of the conspiracy of Perth to rise under Kenneth Mac
Heth, and that Malcolm, after a violent struggle, crushed their
rebellion; but I cannot find any notice of such occurrences in the
historians of this period. Malcolm’s struggle was in Galloway, and the
greater part of Moray, with the exception of the more inaccessible
Highland districts, was by this time in the iron grasp of the great
feudal proprietors established in the forfeited earldom by David.
Kenneth Mac Heth was the companion of Donald Bane, the son of Donald
Mac William, when he rose against Alexander the Second in 1215,
<i>fifty-five years</i> after the conspiracy of Perth. It is possible
that he may have shared in the earlier risings, but it is hardly
probable.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_408" href="#FNanchor_408" class="label">[408]</a> I have here followed the account of Abbot Benedict,
which appears to have been copied into the chronicle of Croyland Abbey.
Compare it with <i>Doc. etc. Illust. Hist. Scot.</i>, No. xxiv., p. 79,
Benedict expressly says that William dispatched the two Earls and de
Moreville from Alnwick “fere cum toto exercitu ... et ibi remansit cum

Such are the words of Benedict, which prove that the enterprise of the
English leaders was entirely based upon their <i>knowledge</i> of the
dispersion of the Scottish army, and their hope of surprising the king
whilst he was only surrounded “privata familia sua.” This view of the
case must enhance our opinion of their judgment, though somewhat at
the expense of the miracle. Robert d’Estoteville, Bernard de Balliol,
Ranulph de Glanville, and William de Vesci, were the principal barons
in favour of the enterprise.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410" class="label">[410]</a> Some idea might be formed of the rate of progression
of a knight in full armour, were it not for the ambiguity of the
expression of Newbridge, “ante horam quintam viginti quatuor millia
passuum transmearent”—“before five o’clock;” or “under five hours,” as
some translate it. But this forced march was looked upon as an almost
incredible performance; and if our forefathers required supernatural
assistance (tanquam <i>propellente vi aliqua</i> properantes) to
accomplish five miles an hour, their ordinary movements must have been
leisurely indeed.</p>

<i>Newbridge</i>, l. 3, c. 35. <i>Diceto</i> and <i>Chron. Gerv.</i>
1174. (<i>Twysden</i>, p. 577, 1427.) Facts have been a little
strained to represent William’s capture as a miracle. All contemporary
accounts agree that Henry sailed from Barfleur on Monday the 8th July,
landing the same evening at Southampton, and hurrying to Canterbury
without delay, where they make him do penance immediately on his
arrival, dating it on Friday the 12th, and bring him to London on the
Saturday, without accounting for the intermediate days. A journey
from Southampton to Canterbury would scarcely require three days’
and nights’ hard riding. Lord Hailes, according to Dr. Lingard,
“contradicts the king, and says that one of these events occurred on
a Thursday, and the other on a Saturday.” Lingard himself makes Henry
spend two days on the passage—a way of accounting for the intermediate
days which seems not to have occurred to the earlier authorities—land
on the 10th, ride all night, reach Canterbury and do penance on the
11th, and proceed to London on the 12th (<i>Hist. Engl.</i>, vol.
2, c. 5); and as William was captured on Saturday the 13th, his own
account, singularly enough, bears out the assertion of Lord Hailes,
“that Henry was scourged on a Thursday and William made prisoner on a
Saturday!” It was quite in accordance with the spirit of the age to
regard the capture of William as the reward of Henry’s penance, and it
can scarcely be questioned that such was the case in England; whilst
the foundation of Arbroath, dedicated to Thomas of Canterbury, seems
to attest William’s concurrence in this feeling. The age was ready to
accept a miracle and it was framed accordingly.</p>

that on the <i>very same day</i> the Count of Flanders and the younger
Henry dismissed the fleet which they had assembled at Gravelines. To
make the story still better, Wendover raises a tempest and sinks most
of the vessels. As the allies left Gravelines on account of a message
from Louis, who had <i>received intelligence of William’s capture</i>
(<i>Hoveden</i>), the knowledge of an event in France, on the very day
on which it happened in Northumberland, would, in those days, have been
undeniably miraculous.</p>

have been given up—Roxburgh, Berwick, and Edinburgh. The latter was
given back as the dowry of Ermengarde, and the two others were restored
by Richard. As Stirling and Jedburgh are never alluded to, it is to be
presumed that, for some cause, they were not claimed by Henry; indeed
Newbridge, l. 2, c. 38, writes that only the three other castles were
made over to the English king; and Wynton follows him, bk. 7, c. 8, l.
159. The treaty in the Fœdera is dated at Falaise; but a passage in
Diceto (to which no allusion is made in the Capitula) states that the
Convention took place near Valognes in the Cotentin; and in the version
of the treaty given in the same passage, the castles of Roxburgh
and Berwick only are mentioned. These were the two castles restored
after the death of Henry, and the writer must have been ignorant not
only that Stirling, Jedburgh, and Edinburgh, were also amongst the
fortresses stipulated to be made over by the Scots, but that the
latter was actually given up. This is another proof, I think, that

drew a great part of the army with which he re-established himself in
Galloway.</p>

five years of age when he received the title of earl; and as he reached
the Orkneys in the year after the expedition of Bishop John, Ronald
must have held the earldom at that time for three years. (<i>Vide

born in 1133, and succeeded to his share in the earldom in 1138. Ronald

was at that time king of Man; and the son of Somarled was hardly more
than a <i>subordinate</i> king of the Sudreys, as he had been defeated
in a contest for superiority by his brother Angus in 1192 (<i>Chron.
Man</i>). An account of some of these transactions is also contained
in the Flatey Book (<i>Col. de Reb. Alb.</i>, p. 351–54), but it is
confused. For instance, after beginning with the death of Harald the
younger, the book makes the elder Harald yield Caithness to <i>Harald
the younger</i> after the expedition of William to Eystein’s Dal. The
account of this expedition must therefore have been misplaced; and
it probably ought to be referred to the time of William’s <i>first
invasion</i> of Caithness. Some idea may be formed of the formidable
power of these northern magnates from the fact that Harald collected
6000 men to oppose William; whose army when he invaded England in 1174,

deputation which John dispatched to William when the king of Scotland
came to Lincoln, it is not improbable that one of the reasons why
William had hitherto refused to meet John was a reluctance on the
part of the latter to carry out Richard’s Charter of Privileges. In
the Introduction to <i>Robertson’s Index</i>, p. xii., No. 3, is the
following entry:—“Charta Johannis Regis Angliæ, missa Willielmo Regi
Scotiæ de tractatu maritagii inter Regem Franciæ et filiam Willielmi
Regis Scotiæ.” There is some mistake here (probably an error of a
copyist), for Philip Augustus was never in a condition during the reign
of John to marry one of William’s daughters. But if the <i>tractatus
maritagii</i> alludes to the proposed betrothal of Alexander to a
French princess, the charter may have been a confirmation by John
of Richard’s Charter of Privileges, dispatched in haste with the
deputation to bring about a reconciliation with William, and to break
off the proposed alliance with France.</p>

the counties was again put off till the following Michaelmas, and it is
difficult to say whether it was ever again raised during the reign of
William, as after the conclusion of Hoveden’s work, no other chronicler
alludes to the subject. Wendover succeeds to Hoveden, whose loss is
great for the historian of Scotland; as the manner in which Wendover
supplies his place can be appreciated from the description of the
meeting at Lincoln, in which the latter, after copying the account of
his predecessor, characteristically omits the reservation, “Salvo jure
suo!” The want of a <i>northern</i> chronicler is very much felt, as
it will be generally found that the monastic writers are most accurate
in their narration of events that occurred in their own neighbourhood.
From exalting Brompton, who wrote at the close of the fourteenth
century, to the position of a contemporary writer, and from some other
similar oversights, Dr. Lingard’s version of these transactions is

England on 6th December 1203, I have placed them under 1204. William
was frequently in England after this meeting at Norham. £10 were paid

£30 when he was at the same place on 16th August 1207. In July 1205

<i>Documents, etc., relating to Hist. Scot.</i>, No. xxi., sec. 26, p.
66) state that William was going to marry one of his daughters to the
Count of Boulogne. <i>Hemingburgh</i>, vol. 1, p. 242, affirms that the
princess was to have been united to the Count of Flanders. Ida, who
brought the earldom of Boulogne to her husband, Reginald de Dammartin,
and whose heiress, Mahout, was married to Prince Philip of France,
was married about 1191, and survived till 1216. There was no Count
of Flanders in 1209. Baldwin of Hainault, who ascended the imperial
throne of Constantinople in 1204, and was slain in the following year,
left by Margaret his wife, who brought him the earldom of Flanders,
two daughters, who became the wards of Philip Augustus. By that king
the eldest, Jane, was given to Ferrand of Portugal in 1211, who in
her right became Count of Flanders and Hainault. It is very clear,
then, that William could not have been negotiating a marriage for one
of his daughters with either a Count of Boulogne, or of Flanders, at
that period; and if any negotiation on such a subject had been set on
foot, it must have been respecting an alliance between the prince of
Scotland and the heiress of Flanders and Hainault. Such a project would
have suited well with the endeavours of Philip to enlist allies against
John, and it would undoubtedly have brought the latter king in all
haste to the northern frontier.</p>

<i>Fœdera</i>, vol. 1, pt. 1, p. 103. <i>Robertson’s Index Introd.</i>,
p. xx. <i>Neg. tang. Ang.</i> No. 3. Such is the account of these
transactions preserved in the Scottish authorities, and the correctness
of their dates is confirmed by the Fœdera and the Patent Rolls.
Wendover is decidedly wrong in referring the whole transaction to
one meeting only, and in placing the treaty, etc., before 28th June.
The Bridlington Chronicle states that John built a castle at Berwick
(<i>i.e.</i>, Tweedmouth) in June, and that the kings came to terms in
August (<i>Documents, etc.</i>, xxi., sec. 26–27), Hemingburgh asserts
that John at first demanded Alexander as a hostage for his father,
the “plura et inaudita” perhaps of Fordun. In spite of the attempt of
Fordun to represent the peace as the result of the interference of
the principal men of both countries, it was evidently brought about
through William’s aversion to war. The message that excited the wrath
of John was dictated in <i>the Council of Stirling</i>; the envoys to
deprecate his indignation were dispatched by William; and the Melrose
chronicler concludes his account with the significant sentence, “It was
done against the wishes of the Scots.” The extreme secrecy about the
tenor of these “mutual charters” is worthy of remark. The Scots always
maintained that one of the princesses was to have married the heir
of the English crown, and Alexander II. afterwards obtained a grant
of lands in satisfaction for his claims upon the northern counties,
and for the alleged infringement of the terms of this arrangement
(<i>Fœd.</i>, vol. 1, pt. 1, p. 233). In the Patent Rolls (An. 21,
Hen. III.) there is the following remark on this latter treaty, “Inter
cœtera apparet quod concordia fuit quod Rex Angliæ duceret Marger’
sororem dicti Regis Scotiæ, quod modo relaxatum fuit ac al’.” All this
tells for the Scottish account. On the other hand, when Hubert de Burgh
was charged with preventing this marriage—in consideration of which
William had agreed to waive his claims on the northern counties—the
Earl of Kent replied that he knew of no such agreement, and appealed to
the letters of Pandulf and others to prove that his own marriage with
the princess Margaret was brought about with the full knowledge and
consent of the English magnates (<i>Mat. Par. Addit.</i> p. 99); and
the <i>Rot. Pat. ad an. 4 Hen. III.</i>, mention an arrangement at York
before Pandulf, in which it was agreed that the sisters of Alexander
should be married “infra Regnum Angliæ ad honorem suum.” Hubert’s
statement, however, only had reference to a guarded defence of his own
conduct, and throws no light upon the events of John’s reign. It is
very probable that John retained the princesses at his court for the
purpose of marrying them to his own sons if anything happened to the
<i>sole male heir</i> of Scotland; and that may have been the reason
why they remained unmarried until after his death. It is not to be
supposed that Hubert de Burgh overlooked the proximity of Margaret to
the Scottish throne when he married her, and it must be acknowledged
that his interpretation of the secret treaties, if he was really aware
of their existence, was very much to his own advantage. The wording of
the letter of William in the <i>Fœdera</i> contradicts the supposition
that the payment of 15,000 marks “pro benevolentia domini nostri
habendâ, <i>et pro conventionibus tenendis</i>,” etc., was a simple
<i>fine</i> imposed by John on the Scottish king.</p>

Ang.</i>, Nos. 7, 36, 40. <i>Fordun</i>, l. 8, c. 72. One of the
Melrose charters (No. 168) proves the date of this homage of Alexander,
and a fragment in the <i>Documents</i>, No. xl., sec. 19, p. 136,
states that the homage was performed “pro omnibus <i>rectitudinibus</i>
pro quibus pater suus fecerat homagium Henrico Regi patri ejusdem
Johannis.” Libertates et <i>rectitudines</i>—privileges and
rights—are the words in Richard’s Charter of Privileges to William. As
half the money—one year’s payment—was remitted, and the whole sum was
to have been paid off in two years, it is allowable to infer that one
year after the treaty, <i>i.e.</i>, in 1210, John must have waived his
claim to the payment of the remainder.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_503" href="#FNanchor_503" class="label">[503]</a> <i>Fordun</i>, l. 8, c. 76. <i>Walter of Coventry, ad
an.</i> 1212. The words of this writer are, “Scotorum Rex Willelmus jam
ætatis provectæ, cum interioris regni sui partes seditione turbatas
pacificare non posset, ad Anglorum Regem confugiens, se et regnum
filiumque quem unicum habibat, ejus commisit provisioni. At ille,
cingulo militari commendatum sibi adolescentem donans, in partes
illas cum exercitu proficiscens, dimissis per interiora regni suis
Guthredum cognomento Mac William, seditionis ducem, cepit et patibulo
suspendit. Erat hic de Scotorum Regum antiquâ prosapiâ, qui Scotorum
et Hibernensium fretus auxilio, longas contra modernos Reges, sicut
et pater suus Duvenaldus, nunc clàm nunc palàm exercuit inimicitias.
Moderniores enim Scotorum Reges magis se Francos fatentur, sicut
genere, ita moribus, linguâ, cultu; Scotisque ad extremam servitutem
redactis, solos Francos in familiaritatem et obsequium adhibent.”
This account, as is so often the case, contains a mixture of truth
and error. The flight of William to John, and John’s campaign in the
Highlands of Scotland during the summer of 1212 (for Godfrey was given
up at that time), are apocryphal, for he was at that time engaged in
his expedition against the Welsh, from which he returned so suddenly,
through fear of treachery. He may have assisted William—perhaps with
some of his foreign Reiters—though he was hardly in a condition at
that time to yield much assistance to any one. The distinction between
the “ancient and modern kings” of Scotland is also imaginary, for
William and his rivals were cousins, equally claiming to represent the
race of Malcolm Ceanmore; though the assertion that their kings were
“Normans, not Scots,” is exactly what the disaffected subjects of the
reigning family would have urged against them. Even the last sentence
is only partially true, for out of the leaders employed in this very
war, the Earls of Fife and Atholl, and Malcolm, son of Morgund of Mar,
were of native Scottish origin; the Earl of Buchan owed his earldom to
his wife, the heiress of a native earl; and Thomas the Durward was also
apparently of a Scottish rather than of a foreign family. In fact, the
feudalized upper classes of <i>Scotia</i> and the lowlands of Moray,
were at this time looked upon as “Normans;” the mountaineers who clung
to “ancient custom,” as the real Scots; their position being reversed a
few generations later, when the former claimed to be “Scots,” regarding
the latter as “Erse” or Irish. There is much truth, however, in this
passage, though it must be taken <i>cum grano</i>.</p>

disparagetur,” are the words. The result of this treaty relieved John
from any fears lest Alexander should contract any alliance with his
enemies. The “liege homage” rendered by William and his son to the
prince Henry, was upon the same principle as he and his brother David,
and, at an earlier period, Malcolm had performed homage to the eldest
son of Henry the Second. Had this homage been rendered—as some seem
to suppose—for the kingdom of Scotland, it is almost needless to
observe that such a stipulation would have been carefully entered in
the treaty, and the Scottish barons would have been summoned to attend
the councils of the English king—as in the latter part of Henry’s
reign—and to aid him in his wars.</p>

occasioned by the rejection of his suit by that baron’s beautiful
wife—William may have acquired his knowledge of the disaffection of
the English nobles through that very lady, who was his own natural
daughter Margaret.</p>

notices these transactions, but his account is strongly borne out by
a letter in the <i>Fœdera</i>, vol. 1, pt. 1, p. 108, to the emperor
Otho, dated at Bamborough 28th January 1213, in which John writes that
he has been detained in the north by arrangements for the security of
that part of his kingdom. It is clear, therefore, that he was upon the
northern frontier in the early part of that year; and his abortive
negotiations with the Scottish king might have easily escaped the
notice of the English chroniclers amidst the important events that
occurred so soon afterwards. From the commencement of the thirteenth
century the authority of Fordun is of far greater weight than before,
and I have found his statements frequently corroborated by the Fœdera
and the Rolls. In the latter part of William’s reign can be traced the
elements of those parties which appear in the subsequent reigns (but
more especially in that of Alexander the Third) as the English and
Scottish factions.</p>

history in 1195, the <i>later years</i> of William must refer to
Richard’s reign. The influence of good Queen Margaret appears to
have died out in the days of her great-grandchildren, and it is to
this probably that the historian alludes, insinuating that it arose
through the fault of their mother, Ada de Warenne. William left several
illegitimate children. His sons were Robert de Lundoniis and Henry
Gellatly, of whom little or nothing is known. His daughters were—1.
Isabella, married in 1183 to Robert de Bruce, and in 1191 to Robert de
Ros. 2. Ada, married in 1184 to Earl Patrick of Dunbar. 3. Margaret,
married in 1192 to Eustace de Vesci; and 4. Aufrida, married to William

wrote feelingly, for though twice elected to the see of St. Davids, the
choice of the Chapter was not confirmed. Right or wrong, the Scottish
sovereigns seem to have persevered in William’s policy, and when Robert
Bruce conferred the earldom of Moray upon Randolph “in libero comitatu
et in liberâ regalitate,” the church patronage was expressly reserved.

every “lord of a vill,” in other words, every “lord of the manor,”—or
